<num> **] in the right frontal lobe.  in regards to empiric treatment  after the brain biopsy  the patient received iv solu- medrol and high doses of antibiotics with broad coverage.  the infectious disease team was also involved in the care of mr. known. all the tests performed on his tissues and fuids obtained under request of the id team  had thus far come back normal.  brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal damage (red neurons). there was no evidence of an infectious doctor on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.  several attempts in decreasing the dose of pentobarbital resulted in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside eeg monitor.  mr. known condition deteriorated even further. he had developed ileus  and his abdomen was hyperextended.  he had been intubated throughout his entire stay in the intensive care unit and was increasingly dependent on ventilatory support.  at this point  the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. after a family meeting  it was decided that mr. known would no longer benefit from aggressive support.  therefore  he was extubated and expired briefly thereafter.                                 name <num>  name <num>   m.d.  md

anesthesia placed in the supine position on her stretcher. there was much difficulty with getting access to her and anesthesia had to place a central line in the subclavian area. her pulse was quite rapid and there was difficulty controlling her blood pressure and difficulty establishing good access.  she was given a unit of blood  but  given her labile pressures and tachycardia  decision was made to hold off on the open treatment.  at this point  ortho team elected to hold both femur fractures reduced with traction and knee immobilizers were placed.  plan was to bring her back to the intensive care unit for supportive care and consider fixation in the future. the patient was taken to the tsicu floor for close observation and care under sedation and intubated.   on [** <num> -

",  the patient was admitted to the hospital given the size of her pe as well as the patient carried other comorbidities.  she was started on iv heparin drip as well as coumadin.  she was continued on atrovent and ventolin nebulizers.  she had a rather uneventful hospital course.  she was also started on morphine sulfate p.r.n. for dyspnea as well as fentanyl nebulizers p.r.n.  she was also started on a trial of solu-medrol for a possible reactive component to her pulmonary disease.  she was transferred back to the hospital on  <date> for a bronchoscopy and possible stenting to palliate some of her symptoms.  she had this procedure on  <date> .  this revealed numerous black plaques in the right main segmental bronchus as well as the left main segmental bronchus.  these were sent for biopsies  washings  and brushings.  the impression of the pulmonary team was that this could be a possible metastatic melanoma.  after the procedure the patient was continued on her atrovent and albuterol nebulizers as well as iv methylprednisolone.  she was also continued on p.r.n. morphine for respiratory distress.  in terms of her other medical issues for her hypertension  she was continued on norvasc.  for her diabetes she was continued on her oral agents and put on a regular insulin sliding scale for her hypothyroidism.  she was continued on her outpatient dose of thyroid hormone.  for her history of stroke she was continued on plavix.  for prophylaxis she was continued on a proton pump inhibitor.

sagittal  reformatted images were generated.   ct of the chest with contrast:  a pacemaker overlies the left upper chest   with wires appropriately positioned.  there is no pericardial effusion.  there  are very small bilateral pleural effusion.  coronary artery calcifications  involve lad  left circumflex and right coronary artery.  there is moderately  severe atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch.   density in the subcarinal station is likely related to fluid in a pericardial  recess rather than an enlarged lymph node ( <num> : <num> ).  no other potential  mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.  there is no axillary  adenopathy.  a peripherally calcified fat-containing structure in the imaged  left breast may represent an oil cyst ( <num> : <num> ).   lung windows demonstrate mild interlobular septal thickening at the extreme  lung bases  possibly related to fluid overload.  a  <num> -mm nodular opacity is  seen in the peripheral right upper lobe ( <num> :

there is a slight tortuous  aortic contour  with vascular calcification.  the hilar and mediastinal  contours are unchanged.  there are tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  there is  mildly prominent pulmonary fissures and interstitial markings.  there is no  focal abnormality to suggest pneumonia.  the underlying osseous structures are  unremarkable. there is nonspecific bowel gas in the abdomen.   impression:  tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  mildly prominent interstitial  markings compatible with mild volume overload.  , on  <date> a cholangiogram was performed to evaluate the bile duct anatomy. this demonstrated severely dilated left-sided hepatic ducts with high- grade stricture approximately  <num>  cm in lenght extending from the confluence of the common hepatic and left hepatic ducts to just central to the confluence of the segment ii and segment iii left hepatic ducts. mildly dilated right anterior ducts were noted with a stricture in the central right anterior ducts as well as a markedly dilated gallbladder were also noted. the patient's post ercp plastic stent was noted within the common duct with extension superiorly into the superior common hepatic duct. the right posterior ducts were not visualized likely due to high grade stricture or obstruction of central right posterior ducts.  an  <num>  french internal/external biliary drain was placed via the left biliary system after cholangioplasty of strictured region to  <num>  mm. on [** <num> - <num> **] she spiked a temperature to  <num> . <num>  with chills. blood and urine cultures were done. all were negative. on [** <num> - <num> **]  bile was sent for culture growing klebsiella pneumoniae.  unasyn had been started prior to the cholangiogram and this was continued for  <num>  days until bile cultures revealed that klebsiella sensitivity to unasyn was indeterminate. it was otherwise pansensitive. unasyn was switched to cipro on [** <num> - <num> **] after  <num>  days of unasyn. fever resolved. overall  lfts trended down.  on [** <num> - <num> **]  a triple phase ct was done showing a large klatskin-type hilar mass with imaging characteristics compatible with a cholangiocarcinoma. there was intrahepatic bile duct dilatation in all segments except for segment iii  where there was an internal-external biliary drain and a biliary stent. the left portal vein was completely encased by tumor and minimal enhancing portal vein is seen. there were numerous enlarged porta hepatis lymph nodes. a small anterior pelvic wall hernia and small pleural effusions were noted.  a cardiac workup was started with tte noting lvef of  <num> - <num> %  mild to moderate mr  mild pulmonary systolic htn. of note  on [** <num> - <num> **]  she had an episode of l chest pain when transferring

that her hct was  <num>  and she was given  <num>  units of prbc. hct increased to  <num> .  on [** <num> - <num> **]  an ercp was performed to remove the previously placed stent at osh. she did have a questionable run of v tach after the procedure. she then underwent placement of left and right wall stents with placement of ptcs thru the wall stents. findings were notable for a klatskin type biliary stricture at confluence of central right and left ducts extending to upper common hepatic duct (obstructive on right)  this was balloon dilated. metallic biliary stenting with two  <num> mm wallstents deployed side by side and extended into the right and left hepatic ducts crossing the stricture at the confluence of the right hepatic ducts. ursodiol was started. the next day  ir removed the right and left ptcs that were thru the wall stents as stents were in satisfactory position. lfts trended down post procedure.  post procedure  she was hypertensive requiring iv hydralazine. she was transferred to the sicu overnight for management. she was extubated and then transferred back to the med-doctor unit.  her case was presented at the tumor board and she was found to be unresectable. after discussing findings with the patient and her family  an oncology consult was obtained. dr. lastname met with her and discusses possible options. a chest ct was recommended to evaluate for any possible metastatic lesions for staging. this showed a few scattered peripheral lung nodules as described  with the largest measuring  <num>  mm in the right upper lobe. small bilateral pleural effusions and mild intralobular septal thickening at the lung bases was noted.  a density in the subcarinal station may represent fluid in a pericardial recess versus an enlarged lymph node. calcified granuloma in the lung and several in the spleen were consistent with prior granulomatous exposure. a follow up outpatient appointment with oncology was set up to discuss options.  pt declared her safe for discharge to home. vna services were arranged. she was discharged with stable vital signs.

that within  <num>  minutes after the tpa infusion was started  she began to move the left arm and leg.  however  later that day  the pt became diaphoretic  agitated and combative.  she went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate into the  <num> 's.  she vomited and was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the intensive care unit.  she was started on a propofol gtt for sedation while intubated  but her sbp transiently dropped into the  <num> 's. she was aggressively bolused with normal saline and started on a neosynephrine gtt to keep her sbp >  <num> mmhg. it was also noted that the pt's left-sided weakness worsened and repeat head ct demonstrated evolution of stroke in the right mca territory.   she was placed on a heparin gtt as her stroke was felt to represent a cardioembolic event given new-onset atrial fibrillation and/or mural thrombus due to inferior cardiac wall hypokinesis noted on echocardiography. with regard to atrial fibrillation and rvr  the pt was started on beta blockade and was transiently on a diltiazem gtt for rate-control. when sedation was weaned and the pt was extubated  she remained aphasic but also profoundly encephalopathic.  eeg was performed and ruled out nonconvulsive status epilepticus (but did demonstrate slowing consistent with encephalopathy). on hospital day five when she was noted to be moving the left side less.  a ct of the head was ordered and demonstrated an infarct in the territory of the left mca. throughout the remainder of the hospital stay  the pt's neurologic examination was most notable for aphasia  abulia  neglect of left half of environment and left greater than right limb weakness. as above  she was maintained on a heparin gtt and after placement of a peg tube  she was started on warfarin with the plan for chronic anticoagulation given cardioembolic stroke.  she will need to be maintained on a heparin gtt with goal ptt  <num> - <num>  until her inr is [** <num> -

have a retrocardiac opacity on cxr after intubation.  this was thought to represent an aspiration pneumonia.  she was completed a  <num>  day course of levofloxacin and metronidazole.   <num> . fen: the pt had a peg tube placed under endoscopic guidance by the gastroenterology service on hospital day  <num> .  note was made of an ulcer in the body of the stomach and daily ppi therapy was continued and should be post-discharge. she did have a slight increase in wbc count after placement of the peg tube  but the gastroenterology service felt that the peg was functioning fine and there was no evidence of localized infection.  the pt should be maintained on tube feeds after discharge.   <num> . cad: the pt was continued on asa  <num> mg daily  beta blockade and a statin.

findings:  the largest collection of low attenuation fluid in the mediastinum  ( <num>  doctor) lies along the left heart border  where the pericardium is incomplete.  it is generally separated from the heart by epicardial fat along the body and  appendage of the left atrium and the left ventricle.  elsewhere  there is only  minimal pericardial effusion.  at the level of its greatest cross-sectional  area  the diameters of the collection are  <num>  x  <num>  mm  and the vertical extent  is roughly  <num>  cm.   the second mediastinal collection is much smaller  and lies in the prevascular  space posterior to the sternal body  at the level of the intrapericardial  right pulmonary artery  well circumscribed  separated from the heart by  pericardium and epicardial fat.  at the level of its greatest cross-sectional  area  the diameters are  <num>  x  <num>  mm and the vertical extent is also nearly  <num>   cm.  the adjacent sternum is intact  with surgical fragments closely apposed  and no evidence of infection either in the bone or presternal soft tissue or  in the adjacent mediastinum.  the attenuation of this fluid   <num>  doctor  is  consistent with serosanguineous fluid.  although this study is not designed  for evaluation of vascular integrity  either regarding the aorta or coronary  grafts  there is no indication of any abnormality.  native coronary arteries  are heavily calcified and there are mild dystrophic calcifications in the  aortic valve.  layering largely posteriorly are moderate-sized nonhemorrhagic  bilateral pleural effusions  with a moderate fissural component on the left.   there is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  dependent atelectasis is minimal.  small high-density deposits in the periphery of both lower lungs are either  aspirated barium or dystrophic calcifications in areas of pulmonary fibrosis.   a one-level complex of chronic compression fracture and disc injury in the  upper lumbar spine is best demonstrated on the sagittal view which also shows  extensive continuous osteophyte formation in the mid and lower thoracic spine  as well as large vertebral osteophytes in the lumbar region.

transferred to the sdu on postoperative day two. heart failure therapy which included coreg  ace-inhibition and diuretics were started. he remained fluid overloaded and initially required aggressive diuresis with intravenous lasix. the lastname center was consulted to assist in the managment of his diabetes mellitus. given his poorly controlled blood sugars  insulin therapy was eventually initiated. he maintained stable hemodynamics but was noted to have occasional non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. he remained asymptomatic. given his low ejection fraction  the ep service was

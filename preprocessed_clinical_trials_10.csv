 t d type diabetes afflicts nearly million people in the united states most of them children or young adults  EOS untreated it is a fatal disease  EOS exogenous insulin administered by multiple injections or by a continuous subcutaneous sc infusion from a wearable pump allow long term survival in those who develop the disease and most who are treated in this way will have a very good health related quality of life  EOS however insulin therapy does not provide normal glycemic control and long term survivors commonly develop vascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy the most common cause of adult blindness and diabetic nephropathy the most common indication for adult kidney transplantation  EOS the diabetes control and complications trial dcct established that these microvascular complications of diabetes can be prevented by maintaining near normal glucose control in patients with t d  EOS however this degree of control is not always achievable despite modern insulin analogs and delivery systems and when achieved it is invariably associated with episodes of insulin induced hypoglycemia that can be life threatening  EOS a small minority of individuals with t d develop hypoglycemia unawareness a condition that is life threatening is associated with severe deterioration in quality of life and activity restriction and is not amenable to medical therapy  EOS the hope of achieving near normal glucose control without hypoglycemia in t d has provided the impetus for developing effective strategies for cell replacement via pancreas or isolated islet transplantation  EOS when successful pancreas transplantation can normalize blood glucose bg in diabetic recipients with associated stabilization and even reversal of microvascular complications  EOS however the risks of the procedure an almost early failure rate due to technical complications anastomotic leak bleeding and infection and the need for lifelong immunosuppression have in most centers limited the target population of this therapy to diabetics years of age with minimal or no coronary artery disease and at some centers pancreas transplant is offered only with concomitant kidney transplant  EOS as a result t d patients in need of cell replacement are often excluded from whole pancreas transplantation  EOS islet transplantation in contrast is accomplished by a much simpler procedure in which the islets are infused into the portal vein  EOS while this procedure is not without risk the procedural morbidity is much less than that of whole pancreas transplantation  EOS on the other hand whereas about of whole pancreas transplant recipients will be insulin independent at one year after their transplant of islet recipients transplanted between and achieved one year insulin independence  EOS this was attributed to low engrafted islet mass combined with high metabolic demand imposed by glucocorticoids used to prevent rejection  EOS in the year the group from edmonton reported a series of consecutive islet transplant recipients treated with islets from multiple donors and a glucocorticoid free immunosuppressive regimen  EOS these islet recipients were insulin free at follow up ranging from  EOS to months  EOS all of the recipients had experienced severe hypoglycemic episodes prior to transplant and afterwards none did  EOS the efficacy of the edmonton approach has now been confirmed by several other centers and represents a major breakthrough in the field  EOS however it has also become clear that in most islet recipients there is loss of graft function over time in edmonton insulin independence rates have declined from at one year to by three years  EOS a multicenter trial using the edmonton protocol has both confirmed the results of the initial experience and raised questions relating to the expansion of the procedure to multiple centers the toxicities of the immunosuppressive regimen and the evaluation of the islet product  EOS in the nih initiated several multi center clinical islet transplantation consortium clinical trials of islet transplantation with the primary goal of establishing islet transplantation as a therapeutic treatment option for patients with type diabetes either already have had a successful kidney transplant or with severe hypoglycemic events and good native renal function  EOS the clinical protocol utilized for these trials improved from the edmonton protocol in that it incorporates t cell depletion anti thymocyte antibody peri transplant anti inflammatory therapy using tumor necrosis factor tnf a blockade aggressive control of glucose homeostasis after transplant with continuing albeit reduced insulin therapy short term anticoagulation therapy peri intraportal islet infusion  EOS northwestern is one of the clinical centers of the consortium and has successfully transplanted a total of eighteen patients with twenty six islet preparations using this protocol in the past two and half years  EOS the current study protocol modifies the protocol of the cit clinical islet transplantation consortium and substituted anti thymocyte polyclonal antibody with alemtuzumab which has been shown to have efficacy in both pre clinical model as well as clinical trials of allogeneic islet transplantation  EOS,type diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin producing pancreatic

background vulvovaginal irritation is a frequent complaint among postmenopausal women who are not on hormone therapy  EOS common symptoms include pruritus  EOS patients describe the irritation to be similar to that of vulvovaginal candidiasis during their reproductive years  EOS clinical improvement is seen with estrogen therapy  EOS most clinicians attribute the symptoms to vaginal dryness secondary to estrogen deficiency  EOS however the underlying pathophysiology of this clinical entity is not well defined  EOS since cytokines have been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of infectious vaginitis and there is evidence to suggest that estrogen influences cytokine production we postulate that estrogen deficiency causes a disturbance in the vaginal cytokine environment similar to that of infectious vulvovaginitis  EOS studies that investigate the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis vulvovaginal candidiasis and vestibulitis have identified changes in the level of antibodies and cytokines in the vagina during these processes  EOS donders and co workers performed a study looking at the correlation between disturbance of the lactobacillary flora vaginal ph interleukin beta il b and interleukin il  EOS menopausal women were excluded from this study  EOS vaginal ph il and il concentrations increased linearly with decreasing lactobacilli by to fold  EOS il concentration was most closely related to decreasing lactobacilli and il concentration was most closely related to positive culture results  EOS regulez garcia fernandez and co worker performed a study to correlate the symptoms of vulvovaginal candidiasis with vaginal ige levels  EOS patients who have clinically overt vulvovaginal candidiasis with classical symptomatology regardless of whether yeast or mycelia is identified in fresh smear or culture had higher ige levels in their vagina than asymptomatic carriers or uninfected controls  EOS this variation of host response has been proposed as one of the mechanism why only some women with vulvovaginal candidiasis experience symptoms  EOS this concept of an imbalance between th to th cell reactivity with preference to the latter was further suggested by puccetti romani and bistoni  EOS in contrary to the findings by regulez garcia fernandez and co workers fidel ginsburg and co workers studied the vaginal associated immunity in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and found that th type response is increased  EOS this area is certainly controversial and requires further investigations  EOS since il has been suggested as one of the cytokines involved in th or immediate type hypersensitivity response it will be of interest to study whether its level is increased for patients with symptomatology  EOS foster and hasday compared the levels of il b and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf a in perineal biopsy between women with vulvar vestibulitis and pain free subjects and found an increase in both cytokines in the former cases  EOS estrogen has been shown to influence cytokine activity in the reproductive tract  EOS garcia velasco and arici published a review article on chemokines and human reproduction  EOS in the article the clinical relevance of chemokines in normal human reproductive events such as ovulation menstruation and implantation were summarized  EOS there was however little information on their relevance in vaginal physiology  EOS this is consistent with the little information on the topic of vaginal physiology in the literature  EOS a study by franklin and kutteh on the variation of immunoglobulins and cytokines in cervical mucus in twelve women on oral contraceptives ocs and fifteen naturally cycling women showed a definite influence of exogenous and endogenous hormones on their levels  EOS cervical iga and il b levels in women taking ortho novum paralleled the increasing dosage of oral norethindrone and the levels decreased after discontinuation of the oral contraceptive  EOS cervical il b and il both peaked just before ovulation in natural cycles  EOS cervical mucus il b levels were found to correlate directly to changes in estrogen level during a natural cycle  EOS vaginal cytokine levels were not investigated in the study  EOS al harth and co workers measured cervicovaginal il b il il il il interferon gamma inf gamma transforming growth factor beta tgf b tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf a macrophage inflammatory protein alpha mip a and tng receptor ii tnfr ii during the follicular and luteal phases of ovulatory cycle of six premenopausal women  EOS cervicovaginal il b and il were found to vary in level throughout the ovulatory cycle  EOS both il b and il were fold higher in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase  EOS other cervicovaginal cytokines levels were not altered between the two phases  EOS plasma il level was higher in the follicular than luteal phase  EOS the investigators hypothesis is that postmenopausal estrogen deficiency causes changes in cytokine levels in the vagina similar to that found with vaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis  EOS a common cytokine etiology will account for the similarity of the symptomatology of infectious vaginitis and postmenopausal vaginal irritation  EOS unpublished preliminary data from a study done on premenopausal women by ballagh in the co operating howard and georgeanna jones institute for reproductive medicine department of obstetrics and gynecology eastern virginia medical school norfolk virginia usa has shown that the mean levels of vaginal il b and il as measured by elisa are higher in the luteal phase than the follicular phase in naturally cycling women  EOS the median level of il b is higher in the luteal phase than follicular phase but that of il is higher in the follicular phase than luteal phase  EOS these results show that vaginal interleukin environment varies throughout the menstrual cycle to another  EOS women on oral contraceptive pills have increased mean levels of both vaginal il b and il compared to naturally cycling women  EOS these data though preliminary support the theory that steroid hormone may play a role in the regulation of vaginal cytokine levels  EOS objective the principal goal of this pilot study is to determine the correlation between postmenopausal vulvovaginal irritative symptoms with vaginal interleukin levels  EOS cytokines to be evaluated in vaginal lavage will include il il il and tnf  EOS plasma interleukin levels will be assessed concurrently and compared to the vaginal levels to ensure that the vaginal levels obtained are not a result of contamination by plasma transudate  EOS this study is thought to be the basis for a future randomised controlled trial involving the treatment of symptomatic menopausal women for investigation whether the resolution of the symptoms with e  EOSg  EOS estrogen and dhea therapy is associated with a decrease in the interleukin levels  EOS methods screening investigations visit history and physical examination vaginal ph koh prep whiff test and wet prep for trichomonas vaginalis cervical sample for neisseria gonorrhea chlamydia

vaginal lavage samples,many postmenopausal women suffer from vaginal symptoms such as dryness itching and painful intercourse  EOS the underlying pathology is unknown  EOS since symptoms are comparable to those found in infectious vaginitis during the reproductive life stage the investigators hypothesize that the vaginal milieu in symptomatic postmenopausal women is comparable to inflammation in vaginitis  EOS the investigators therefore study vaginal cytokines in symptomatic and asymptomatic postmenopausal women  EOS
access and engagement in evidence based psychotherapies for veterans are high priorities for the veterans health administration especially the office of rural health and the office of mental health

research and development access two of health services research development s research priorities access rural health and mental health and three of secretary shinseki s transformational initiatives for the st century including improving access to care mental health and patient centeredness  EOS this proposed work is innovative as it focuses on a rapidly emerging mobile technology that has great potential to improve access and engagement in mental health service delivery  EOS to date there have been no randomized effectiveness trials that have examined smartphone apps for mental health service delivery  EOS the project is also timely as there is a temporary moratorium imposed by the office of information technology on app dissemination within veterans health administration presenting an opportunity to study moving forward prior to its release  EOS at the completion of this project investigators expect that the work proposed in this study will highlight the clinical value of the moving forward app which will inform both va policy makers and the scientific community at large about the utility of smartphone technology in mental health care delivery  EOS investigators also expect that this study will provide our partners at mental health services with helpful feedback on the moving forward app design and future app development  EOS,this project will be the first to evaluate the moving forward app in va  EOS identifying an effective treatment for anxiety and depression in primary care is imperative within veterans health administration as they are both common chronic and debilitating conditions associated with a number of personal and health related costs  EOS in close partnership with app developers at mental health services a major contribution of this research is the actionable feedback on the acceptability feasibility and effectiveness of augmenting traditional problem solving therapy with the moving forward app for future app

the vte related research questions identified by the east management guidelines as needing further study are  EOS while numerous risk factors for vte have been identified and reported there are only that have level evidence to support them spine fracture and spinal cord injury  EOS many of the other reported risk factors were identified in studies that did not have protocols for surveillance reported only on patients with symptoms or used data from large administrative databases such as the national trauma data bank  EOS it has also been shown that the frequency of diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis dvt increases when more duplex imaging of the extremities is undertaken  EOS thus if an aggressive concurrent surveillance program for dvt and aggressive work up of suspected pulmonary embolism pe is undertaken  EOS are there unknown or under reported risk factors ?  EOS is there a hierarchy of risk among the factors ? for example is a long bone fracture associated with a higher incidence of vte than a closed head injury ?  EOS do all closed head injuries with an ais have the same degree of risk or is an epidural hematoma more risky than a subdural hematoma ?  EOS what constitutes high and very high risk ?  EOS what is the comparative efficacy and value of unfractionated heparin uh low molecular weight heparin lmwh and direct thrombin inhibitors dti with or without associated mechanical prophylaxis mp in preventing vte in trauma patients ? in examining this question the morbidity of these agents must be carefully determined particularly with respect to intracranial injury and intra abdominal solid viscus injury  EOS  EOS in trauma patients who develop vte what is the best treatment and for how long ?  EOS should all trauma patients who develop proximal deep venous thrombosis pdvt undergo a workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of inverse risk inverse risk meaning a patient with a minor injury who is thought to be at low risk who develops pdvt ? similarly should trauma patients who develop pulmonary embolism pe undergo a workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of inverse risk question adds importance to answering questions a and b ?  EOS a recent meta analysis of observational studies suggests that prophylactic inferior vena cava filters picvf significantly reduce the risk of pe or  EOS  EOS  EOS the authors of the meta analysis point out a number of methodological flaws with the studies selected for the analysis  EOS most importantly all were retrospective studies with historical controls and the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis was not uniform among the studies evaluated  EOS despite this report there is continued significant practice variation in the use of pivcf and the role of pivcf in the care of trauma patients remains at question  EOS thus if an aggressive concurrent surveillance program for dvt and aggressive work up of suspected pe is undertaken  EOS are all patients perceived to be at high risk for vte who also have a relative or absolute contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis receiving a pivcf ?  EOS do pivcf reduce the risk of pe in trauma patients in whom risk adjustment has been done ?  EOS do pivcf have value for the trauma patient at very high risk for vte the high risk trauma patient or the moderate risk trauma patient ? in examining this question the morbidity of pivcf must be carefully determined particularly with respect to their placement including local complications at the insertion site their migration and degree of tilt and long term complications  EOS  EOS because most dvt is asymptomatic the clinical examination is extremely insensitive  EOS therefore surveillance of the lower extremity venous systems is necessary  EOS however the use of routine surveillance is controversial  EOS it is also known that venous duplex exams while very accurate in the symptomatic patient can be quite insensitive in the asymptomatic patient  EOS in addition surveillance scanning is hampered by external fixators and wounds as many as of extremities cannot be scanned for this reason  EOS finally it is not uncommon for trauma patients to have a pe even a fatal pe with negative followup surveillance of the lower extremity le and upper extremity ue venous systems  EOS this would suggest either that the surveillance duplex was inaccurate or the clot arose in a vein that could not be well interrogated by duplex i  EOSe  EOS the hypogastric or that the clot arose de novo in the pulmonary artery  EOS thus if an aggressive concurrent surveillance program for dvt and aggressive work up of suspected pe is undertaken  EOS does protocolized surveillance surveillance of asymptomatic patients have value ? in other words does the quality of the outcome determining the presence of asymptomatic thrombus in the vein of an extremity justify the cost ?  EOS what constitutes the most effective protocol in terms of when the initial scan should be done and the frequency of subsequent scans ?  EOS what is the fate of peroneal vein and tibial vein clot ? does it vary depending on the degree of risk i  EOSe  EOS more likely to propagate in patients who are at the highest risk compared to patients with lower risk ? the same question could be posed with respect to soleal vein or gastrocnemius vein clot  EOS  EOS does magnetic resonance venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a surveillance modality particularly those with pelvic fractures or severe le fractures that cannot be reliably scanned ?  EOS does contrast venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a surveillance modality particularly in patients who have had a pe and who have a negative duplex ?  EOS since it has been shown by numerous authors that there is surveillance bias with regard to the diagnosis of dvt i  EOSe  EOS the diagnosis is more often reported at hospitals doing more frequent scanning does the frequency of the diagnosis of pe increase as the number of chest ct angiograms are performed ?  EOS recent studies suggest an association between local or systemic inflammation and pulmonary thrombosis perhaps not embolism  EOS is there an increased risk of dvt or primary pulmonary thrombosis for trauma patients who have an associated inflammatory process such as sepsis urinary tract infection uti or pneumonia pna ? what constellation of local injury puts a patient at risk for pulmonary thrombosis ? we are proposing to perform an extensive literature review on each of these questions to produce a state of the art publication in follow up of the east management guidelines and to provide a platform for a multicenter study of each or all of these questions  EOS,venous thromboembolism vte remains a leading cause of death in trauma patients  EOS based on the east management guidelines for the prevention of vte in trauma patients a number of research questions could be addressed by a thorough current literature review combined with a multicenter concurrent analysis  EOS this proposal seeks to create a data registry of trauma patients from multiple trauma centers around the united states that will serve as a platform for the study of vte  EOS

background readiness cervical spinal cord injury sci is a life altering injury that results in profound loss of upper limb function  EOS nerve transfer surgery has transformed the field of peripheral nerve injury surgery allowing remarkable restoration of upper limb motor function  EOS the investigators expanded use of nerve transfer surgery to cervical sci patients and are the first center to successfully restore volitional hand function in a patient with a c motor level injury now years post surgery  EOS results in more patients show early functional gains at months post surgery most gains are expected at months and these patients are still early in their course  EOS the proposed study will obtain formative outcomes data from a pilot investigation of nerve transfer surgery to restore upper extremity function in patients with cervical sci  EOS upper extremity and hand function is essential to basic activities of daily living and independence patients with cervical sci rate this as more important than walking and sexual performance  EOS restoration of critical upper extremity and hand function requires the unique expertise and technical skill of hand surgeons traditionally tendon transfer tenodesis are used  EOS although studies report reasonable outcomes in sci patients for this procedure use is limited particularly in the us  EOS nerve transfers offer an alternative and promising approach  EOS in peripheral nerve injury nerve transfers are well established safe and are often the treatment of choice  EOS a nerve transfer uses an expendable donor nerve and coapts this to a nonfunctional recipient nerve to restore volitional motor function  EOS since a nerve transfer reinnervates the musculotendinous unit responsible for the absent but desired function this procedure does not have the biomechanical limitations of tendon transfers can use expendable donor nerves whose muscles cannot be used for tendon transfer i  EOSe  EOS the brachialis and a single donor nerve can provide more than one function via reinnervation of multiple muscles  EOS most importantly for sci patient acceptability nerve transfers do not require prolonged periods of immobilization early resumption of activity is encouraged  EOS preliminary data case reports offer early evidence that this novel application of nerve transfers may be a better alternative to tendon transfers in sci  EOS based on our extensive experience with nerve transfers in peripheral nerve injury we expect this approach will have a profound impact on improving function independence and health related quality of life qol  EOS the purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the feasibility safety and outcomes of nerve transfers in sci patients via systematically collected data and to evaluate patients perspective of the benefits and disadvantages of nerve transfers  EOS these data are vital for patient selection patient and surgeon education and adaptation of this well established technique to this unique and traditionally underserved patient population  EOS hypothesis and approach hypothesis nerve transfers are safe effective procedures that have a role in the treatment armamentarium of cervical sci associated upper extremity dysfunction  EOS aim to document the safety time course and improvement potential for nerve transfers to improve functional outcomes by assessing pre and post operative function  EOS aim to evaluate the feasibility and suitability of nerve transfers through multidisciplinary evaluation electrodiagnostic testing ultrasound and nerve specimen examination and correlation with the clinical outcome  EOS aim to assess patient satisfaction with and acceptability for this treatment by use of semi structured patient interviews  EOS,the goal of the investigators work is to establish how nerve transfers can be best used to improve upper extremity function in patients with cervical level spinal cord injury sci  EOS the investigators hypothesis is that nerve transfers are safe and effective and will improve function and quality of life in patients with loss of upper function due to spinal cord injury  EOS the investigators plan on looking at upper limb function and health related quality of life in patients before and after surgery to better understand how patients benefit from these treatments  EOS a nerve transfer procedure can be used to rewire the system to make some muscles work again following sci  EOS the nerve transfer procedure which is done in the arm and not at the level of the spinal cord can be used to bypass the damaged area and to deliver a signal from the brain to a muscle that became disconnected following that injury  EOS a donor nerve is taken from another muscle whose use is not essential and then transferred to help in providing more a more critical function  EOS for example one type of nerve transfer is done to restore the lost ability to pinch or grasp small objects between the fingers that occurs in many patients with cervical sci  EOS in this surgery a donor nerve that normally helps flex the elbow  EOS this nerve can be used because the biceps muscle is also working to flex the elbow  EOS this donor nerve is cut and re attached to the nerve going to muscles in the forearm that provide pinch by bending the tips of the thumb and index finger  EOS because the nerve transfer procedure involves cutting and reattaching nerve and muscle tissues time is required to regenerate working connections between the nerves and muscle as well as to allow the brain to relearn how to use and strengthen that muscle  EOS

the two most important causes of iron overload disease in humans are the iron loading disorder hereditary hemochromatosis hc and transfusional siderosis in patients with chronic hematological diseases like myelodysplastic syndrome mds thalassemia and leukemia  EOS hemochromatosis  EOS in hc the molecular regulation of iron uptake across the intestinal mucosa is disturbed leading to hyperabsorption and accumulation of iron in parenchymal tissues such as the liver pancreas endocrine organs and heart  EOS hepcidin a small peptide hormone synthesized in the liver apparently functions as the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis by its ability to control the efflux of iron from the enterocytes and macrophages into blood plasma  EOS this happens by diminishing the iron transfer capacity through the basolateral transmembrane protein ferroportin  EOS expression of hepcidin is carefully adjusted by the iron status of the hepatocytes through a multimolecular signal transducing pathway which acts as a positive feedback mechanism with increased hepcidin synthesis in iron overload and inflammation  EOS mutation of one of the signal molecules leads to inadequate hepcidin synthesis  EOS the most common are the classic c y and h d point mutations of the hemochromatosis protein hfe which disturbs its interaction with the transferrin receptor the first step in the hepcidin signal cascade  EOS homozygosity for c y is the strongest risk factor for serious iron overload and disease which develops after a long lasting asymptomatic period  EOS in norway the prevalence of c y homozygosity is approximately  EOS in both genders  EOS the preclinical biochemical phenotype of hc is disclosed by blood tests with elevated transferrin saturation as a marker of hyperabsorption of iron and increasing ferritin concentration as a surrogate marker of a growing iron overload  EOS as an alternative to liver biopsy magnetic resonance imaging mri seems to be a powerful non invasive method to directly assess the iron content of the liver and heart  EOS myelodysplastic syndrome and transfusional siderosis  EOS transfusional iron overload is the result of multiple blood transfusions supplied over a long time period each of which adds approximately to mg of extra iron to the body  EOS because iron loading occurs via a parenteral route with the macrophages as the primary target cells the normal homeostatic mechanisms are not responding adequately and the plasma hepcidin level can be normal or even increased  EOS even if excess iron is better tolerated in macrophages than in parenchymal cells a life threatening iron overload develops much faster with transfusional siderosis than hfe associated hc  EOS myelodysplastic syndrome mds is a heterogeneous group of stem cell disorders with inefficient hematopoiesis and increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia  EOS the mds international prognostic scoring system ipss which is based on numbers of cytopenias cytogenetic features and number of blasts in the bone marrow enables separation of four risk groups with the following median survival years low risk patients  EOS years intermediate  EOS years intermediate  EOS years and high risk  EOS years  EOS many patients become transfusion dependent and get serious transfusional iron overload  EOS iron chelation is recommended to low risk and intermediate patients with probable need of lifelong transfusion therapy  EOS consequences of iron overload  EOS if not interrupted continuous iron loading will at some point start to gradually damage vital organs such as liver heart and endocrine organs and lead to serious disease and a shortened lifetime  EOS at the molecular level persistently increased amounts of reactive small molecular weight iron complexes or the sporadic presence of free iron in blood and tissues are probably the fundamental pathogenetic mechanism in iron overload  EOS these substances are highly toxic due to their strong ability to catalyze the formation of free radicals such as reactive oxygen species ros  EOS the activity of free radicals with damage of native molecules e  EOSg  EOS dna and cellular structures is considered to be the first step in organ and tissue injury  EOS in blood reactive iron exists as non transferrin bound iron ntbi mainly in the form of small molecular weight iron citrate complexes  EOS ntbi is rapidly taken up by the liver and other organs where it adds to the intracellular reactive labile iron pool lip  EOS the presence of ntbi and lip has been found to correlate with hepatic and cardiac damage in transfusional siderosis and hc  EOS in addition the homeostasis of other trace metals may be abnormal in iron overload  EOS little is known about this issue which warrants a deeper study  EOS treatment  EOS in hc the preferred iron removal therapy is venesection whilst transfusional iron overload is treated with iron chelators  EOS clinical aims of study  EOS the major objective is to determine the efficacy of deferasirox to remove iron from the liver heart and bone marrow in hc and mds patients with iron overload  EOS explorative aims  EOS determine the correlation between the novel biomarkers hepcidin and ntbi and ferritin and transferrin saturation in serum and liver iron concentration lic heart iron concentration hic and bone marrow iron  EOS assess the effect of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection on the concentration of trace metals in serum and urine in hc and mds patients  EOS study the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection on intracellular signal transduction in blood cells isolated from hc and mds patients  EOS study the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection on oxidative damage of dna examined in urine and the antioxidant status in red blood cells isolated from hc and mds patients  EOS establish reference values for the investigational serum and urine tests in healthy control subjects  EOS rationale of the study  EOS the major rationale of the study is related to the need to assess the potential use of deferasirox to treat hc and mds patients with iron overload  EOS however several learning objectives are included the impact of iron overload and iron depleting treatment on ntbi hepcidin markers of oxidative stress trace metals and intracellular signal transduction molecules  EOS although venesection is a safe and effective means of depleting iron in hc patients it may suppress hepcidin and thus increase iron absorption particularly at the end of a long treatment period  EOS also some hc patients not only feel the cumbersome impact of frequent phlebotomies in daily life but also experience troublesome side effects  EOS the subjective perception of venesection side effects was recently communicated in a survey study among hc patients across the united states and some european countries  EOS of these of patients undergoing weekly venesections and of the patients in the maintenance phase reported side effects always or most of the time and would definitely or probably refuse phlebotomy if they were offered an alternative treatment  EOS therefore investigation of the effect of chelator as a potential alternative therapy in hc is warranted  EOS chelation therapy may not only remove excess iron from the body but may also counteract formation of reactive free radicals  EOS in mds patients transfusion dependency worsens the survival due to development of damaging iron overload  EOS with every ng ml increase of s ferritin above the threshold the risk of death increases by  EOS traditionally iron depletion therapy has been monitored by s ferritin which decreases as iron is progressively eliminated  EOS however s ferritin is a non specific parameter which is sensitive to acute phase reactions associated with inflammations chronic diseases and tissue injury  EOS furthermore s ferritin does not offer information about the burden of free radical production stimulated by reactive iron  EOS for this reason one aim of this study will be to investigate whether new blood markers like ntbi and hepcidin along with mri assessment of lic and hic will improve the diagnosis of iron overload and more accurately identify those patients who are at increased risk of iron induced damage and therefore will benefit from iron depletion therapy  EOS iron overload can weaken the cellular antioxidant defence and result in oxidative dna damage as the first step in carcinogenesis  EOS examination of the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection on oxidative damage of dna and on the antioxidant status in red blood cells will be performed  EOS increased knowledge of how intracellular signal transduction is influenced by cellular iron and use of deferasirox may provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of iron overload  EOS this will be examined in single leukocyte cell flowcytometry assays of the following intracelluar signal parameters stress sensor p mtor and nfkb  EOS finally little is known about how iron overload interacts with the metabolism of other trace metals  EOS the concentration of a broad spectrum of trace metals in serum s and urine u will be monitored throughout the study period by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms boron s u barium s u beryllium s u cadmium s u cobalt s u cesium s u copper s u mercury u lithium u manganese s molybdenum s nickel s u lead s u antimony s u selenium s u tin s u strontium s u thallium s u tungsten s yttrium s u zinc s u  EOS the tolerability of deferasirox will also be assessed throughout the study either as sole treatment in mds patients or compared to venesection in hc patients  EOS healthy volunteers are used solely as controls to determine the normal blood concentration of the biomarkers and tests which will be performed in the patients  EOS the controls will not be treated  EOS previous clinical trials in hc and mds  EOS deferasirox has been studied in a variety of diseases with transfusional iron overload particularly in thalassemia  EOS it has a favorable profile with respect to efficacy safety and tolerability  EOS however controlled clinical studies with deferasirox in hc and mds are limited  EOS the study by phatak et al was the first clinical trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in patients with c y homzygot hemochromatosis  EOS they showed that serum ferritin levels were reduced similarly in two cohorts given respectively mg kg day and mg kg day of deferasirox  EOS since the dose of mg kg day caused a higher frequency of adverse events aes they recommended a staring dose of mg kg day to be most appropriate in hc patients  EOS the most important aes were associated with an increase in serum creatinine and liver enzymes  EOS the study was limited by pretreatment of some patients with phlebotomy prior to the deferasirox study in addition many of the patients had only mild iron overload  EOS for this reason we see no argument to use a higher dose in our study and therefore we choose a starting deferasirox dose of mg kg day in hc patients  EOS in a recent study heavily transfused mds patients were enrolled to receive weeks of deferasirox therapy  EOS deferasirox was well tolerated and effectively reduced lic labile plasma iron and s ferritin in patients completing to weeks of therapy despite ongoing receipt of red blood cell transfusions  EOS in addition to reducing long term toxicity of iron overload chelation therapy has shown beneficial effects on hematopoiesis in a small proportion of mds patients  EOS one ongoing study comparing deferasirox with placebo was found in cochrane search carried out in june  EOS pharmacokinetics of deferasirox  EOS deferasirox exjade is a bivalent iron chelator which is taken orally as a tablet once per day  EOS it is readily absorbed and reaches peak concentration in blood after to hours  EOS the half life is to hours and effective levels of active chelator are maintained in the blood for more than hours  EOS the drug is eliminated via the hepatobiliary system  EOS the dose varies from mg kg day in patients with mild iron overload to mg kg day in patients with overt iron toxicity  EOS adverse events aes of deferasirox  EOS the most frequent adverse clinical events are gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash  EOS the most frequent laboratory side effects are mild increase in serum creatinine and liver transaminases  EOS the adverse events have for the most part been reported in patients with transfusional iron overload  EOS in hc patients the data are more scarce due to the very few studies that have been performed in this group  EOS other common aes include headache constipation abdominal distension dyspepsia pruritus and proteinuria  EOS less common aes include anxiety sleep disorder dizziness early cataract maculopathy hearing loss pharyngolaryngeal pain gastrointestinal hemorrhage gastric ulcer duodenal ulcer gastritis oesophagitis hepatitis cholelithiasis pigmentation disorder renal tubulopathy glycosuria pyrexia edema and fatigue  EOS adverse reactions reported during post marketing experience include pancytopenia hypersensitivity reaction hepatic failure leukocytoclastic vasculitis urticaria erythema multiforme alopecia acute renal failure and tubulointerstitial nephritis gallstones and related biliary disorders elevations of liver transaminases and hepatic failure  EOS any such adverse events will be recorded in the subject s case report form crf  EOS study design  EOS the study incorporates arms which will recruit in parallel arm open randomized comparative will consist of patients with confirmed hc who will be randomized to receive standard treatment with venesection withdrawal of ml blood

objective multiple pet ligands exist for imaging metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mglur  EOS the selection of best pet ligand to image mglur is necessary for a larger clinical study in patient population but choosing such a ligand is likely difficult because the radioligands are evaluated under different conditions and in different subject populations  EOS the purpose of this study is to determine the best pet ligand for imaging mglur receptors in brain of healthy subjects  EOS this will be accomplished by measuring mglur receptor occupancy in the same subject using two pet ligands having high affinity at mglur c sp and c fpeb and using stx a negative allosteric modulator at mglur receptors to block the radioligand brain uptake  EOS the two radioligands were chosen among many based on the recommendation from the mglur working group  EOS two serial pet scans using c sp and c fpeb will be performed under baseline condition on one day and under receptor blocked condition on another day  EOS as c fpeb has not been evaluated in humans before we plan to acquire brain and whole body dosimetry scans before measuring receptor occupancy  EOS furthermore we wish to compare fpeb labeled with c and f in the same subject two brain pet scans using c fpeb and f fpeb will be done serially in the same subject on the same day  EOS fpeb labeled with c has the same structure as fpeb labeled with f and is therefore expected to yield similar binding measures  EOS study population healthy volunteers aged to years  EOS design to characterize brain uptake and distribution of radioligand an initial cohort of healthy volunteers n up to will undergo brain pet scans using c fpeb  EOS to estimate radiation absorbed doses for c fpeb a cohort of healthy volunteers n up to will undergo whole body pet or pet ct scans  EOS a subsequent cohort of healthy volunteers n up to will have two scanning sessions a baseline i  EOSe  EOS medication free and b blocking i  EOSe  EOS with medication  EOS each scanning session will be with two serial pet scans c fpeb and c sp in a day scans in morning and afternoon  EOS the blocking session will be after administration of stx at which time we will also measure the concentration of stx in plasma  EOS both scanning sessions would include an arterial line and measurement of the input function of parent radioligand separated from radiometabolites as well as plasma free fraction of radioligand  EOS we plan to study up to two doses of stx with three to five subjects at each dose  EOS the blockade of brain uptake of c fpeb and c sp will be plotted as a function of the plasma concentration of stx  EOS a further cohort of healthy volunteers n up to will undergo two serial brain pet scans with c fpeb and f fpeb in the same day one scan in the morning and the other in the afternoon  EOS outcome measures the radioligands will be evaluated on three criteria  EOS peak brain uptake  EOS higher uptake is better because it provides more robust signal that can be imaged for a longer time  EOS  EOS time stability of distribution volume  EOS if the measurement of receptor binding i  EOSe  EOS distribution volume is stable with increasing lengths of imaging the result is good and consistent with the lack of radiometabolites in brain  EOS  EOS ratio of specific to non displaceable uptake in brain  EOS the receptor occupancy study can be analyzed with the so called lassen plot to calculate non displaceable free radioligand plus non specifically bound uptake in brain  EOS the better radioligand has the better ratio of signal to noise which in this case is the ratio of specific to nondisplaceable uptake  EOS,background a small brain protein called the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mglur may affect several brain diseases such as autism and depression  EOS researchers will use radioactive chemicals c sp and c fpeb and a research drug stx that can attach to the receptor to figure out the best way to use positron emission tomography pet to see the mglur receptor  EOS they will use scans to monitor where the radioactivity goes  EOS objectives to find the best way to image the mglur receptor in

clinical trials of cell therapy in pd patients were first performed in lund in the late s followed by a number of similar small trials in other european and north american centres  EOS these initial studies performed on small groups of advanced pd patients were all open label but firmly established safety of the procedure  EOS the results obtained in these trials have shown that the grafted dopaminergic da neurons can survive and function long term over more than years and that some patients have shown clear clinical benefits especially with respect to their bradykinesia and rigidity with reductions in l dopa requirements  EOS using functional imaging it has also been shown that the grafted da neurons can restore striatal da release and provide a sustained re activation of motor cortical areas i  EOSe  EOS key areas that were underactive prior to grafting  EOS post mortem studies have shown excellent long term survival of the grafted da neurons notwithstanding the observation that some of the long term surviving transplants at years after grafting have now been shown to contain signs of pd related pathologies i  EOSe  EOS neuronal lewy bodies and alpha synuclein positive inclusions in the grafts  EOS however such changes have been observed only in some and not in all patients and when seen the extent of the pathology is limited to a small number of the grafted da cells and the clinical consequence if any not known  EOS however the outcomes of two nih sponsored double blind placebo controlled trials which published their main findings in and have raised major concerns  EOS in both these trials the grafted patients did not show any significant improvement overall compared to sham operated controls at and years post grafting  EOS furthermore a significant number of patients in both trials developed gids which in some cases were so severe that further neurosurgery was needed to remedy the situation  EOS the reasons for the variable and overall poor outcome in these trials including the generation of gids have been the subject of much debate but have recently centred on three key elements with an additional possible fourth element the selection of patients in terms of clinical phenotype disease stage and pattern of striatal dopaminergic denervation at the time of grafting the differences in immunosuppressive regimes and the risk that incomplete immunosuppression in combination with the use of solid graft methods may lead to the development of detrimental immune inflammatory reactions at the graft site with compromise of the grafted dopamine cell function the mode of engraftment and differences in graft cell survival and the risk for inhomogeneous delivery of dopaminergic neurons and the generation of potentially dyskinesia inducing patchy innervations in the host striatum a final possible element is the composition of the grafted tissue and the ratio of serotoninergic to dopaminergic neurons within the graft  EOS there is emerging evidence that serotoninergic neurons can release dopamine in a relatively unregulated fashion given they lack transporters for it and as such may use l dopa as a false transmitter which may not only underlie the development of l dopa induced dyskinesia s but may also contribute to gids  EOS failure of the nih trials to demonstrate any overall clinical benefits in the grafted patients and the unexpected and worrisome development of gids in a significant number of patients in these trials has represented a major hurdle for the future development of cell based therapies for pd and it is in this and related areas that this project seeks to move the field forward and go beyond the current state of the art for this treatment approach  EOS this project has gathered together all the available expertise in this area to resolve or reduce the risk of the previous complications seen with vm transplants in patients with pd  EOS we will conduct a new round of clinical trials involving a step by step optimisation of all technical aspects of the grafting procedure and patient selection and assessment in order to improve clinical efficiency and consistency in the absence of troublesome dyskinesia s  EOS,the transeuro transplant study is a trial which will involve grafting foetal tissue into the brain of patients with parkinson s disease who are already been followed in the observational study  EOS the tissue inserted in the brain is to help replace and rebuild lost dopamine from the brain due to parkinson s disease  EOS only patients will be selected for the transplant  EOS
background based on the various reports indicating health hazards of gutka and pan masala there are various efforts to ban the production consumption sale storage and transportation of these products by various states in india  EOS the situation had gone to such an extent that government had no other option than to ban these products  EOS in india gutka is classed as a food item and falls within the purview of prevention of food adulteration act  EOS the central committee on food standards ccfs had already reported a complete ban to the central government a decade ago itself  EOS the reasons unanimously given by ccfs for a complete ban on gutka were children are getting addicted to these products in large numbers users develop oral submucous fibrosis and cancer over a relatively shorter duration and die earlier compared to smokers women prefer smokeless tobacco due to social disapproval of their smoking and therefore may be particularly vulnerable to gutka addiction  EOS tamil nadu had banned gutka in itself  EOS andhra pradesh goa maharashtra rajasthan had also followed the same in august  EOS subsequently following some legal battles ban on gutka in maharashtra was lifted  EOS but now following the example of eight other states in india government of maharashtra has finally banned the manufacture storage distribution or sale of gutka and pan masala containing either tobacco and or nicotine or magnesium carbonate as ingredients by whatsoever name these are available in the market and any other products marketed separately to constitute as gutka and pan masala etc  EOS as final products from july  EOS the appeal filed by some manufacturers in bombay high court has been quashed and the ban is to continue now unless it is reversed by the supreme court of india  EOS sensing the possibility of supreme court sc appeal by gutka and pan masala manufacturers the government of maharashtra has already filed an caveat there so that there plea will be heard first by sc before passing any order in this matter  EOS there is a large population addicted to gutkha and pan masala all over india  EOS we would like to study the impact of this ban on the users of this product and on the tobacco vendors  EOS even if the ban is reversed by the supreme court we would still like to study its impact in the interim period when the ban was imposed  EOS rationale seeing the addictive potential of the contents of gutka and pan masala it will be interesting to record the effect of ban of these products on the regular consumers  EOS whether they have stopped the consumption or are still getting the products by smuggled routes is an important issue  EOS if they have shifted to other tobacco products it will be important to study the shift pattern  EOS if at all some withdrawal symptoms are reported by them it will be helpful to record it so as to devise our cessation strategies  EOS if the previous regular consumers have stopped the consumption of gutka and pan masala because of ban it is positive sign in support of legal ban for the maintenance of proper public health  EOS the response of gutka and pan masala users to the ban has to be studied  EOS to what extent they have accepted the ban and what reaction they are giving are important issues to be studied  EOS in depth analysis of all these points will be helpful in the development of further public health strategy as far as use of gutka and pan masala is concerned  EOS the second aspect of this study is to investigate the response and implications of tobacco vendors to the ban  EOS in last few years there was tremendous increase in vendors of tobacco especially gutka and pan masala  EOS these products being cheaply available were marketed in almost all corners of cities and villages  EOS even public transport vehicle were also flooded by the presence of many street vendors  EOS ultimately all these vendors were working as the merchants of deadly tobacco products  EOS so the study of the response of these people to ban is an issue of interest  EOS the implication of the ban on them if studied in depth can help us to devise some strategy for their rehabilitation and preventive programmes to deter them from indulging into such type of business  EOS we may also get some newer insights to strengthen the ban  EOS aim and objectives  EOS to assess the knowledge of gutkha and pan masala users regarding the ban  EOS to assess the awareness regarding health hazards of gutkha and pan masala among the users  EOS to investigate the effectiveness with which the gutkha and pan masala ban has been implemented  EOS to determine the impact of gutkha and pan masala ban on previous users in terms of availability reduction of use quitting switch over to other tobacco products cost of available products etc  EOS  EOS to understand the perception of gutkha and pan masala among users regarding the ban  EOS  EOS to record any personal positive or negative experience e  EOSg  EOS health effects that the user experienced after the ban  EOS  EOS to assess the perception of tobacco vendors regarding the ban  EOS  EOS to understand the financial implications of the ban on the vendors  EOS to record if the vendors still sell gutkha and pan masala and the details regarding the same source brands costing etc  EOS  EOS to record if the tobacco vendors themselves were

the incidence of craniosynostosis is reported to be births  EOS craniosynostosis is a birth defect that causes one or more sutures on a baby s head to close earlier than normal  EOS the skull of an infant or young child is made up of bony plates that allow for growth of the skull  EOS the borders at which these plates intersect are called sutures or suture lines  EOS early closing of a suture causes the baby to have an abnormally shaped head  EOS original contributions by dr  EOS paul tessier along with technological advances improved pediatric anesthesia rigid fixation resorbable plates endoscopic techniques and distraction have significantly advanced surgical treatment for these patients over the past years  EOS primary indication for operative treatment for patients with craniosynostosis is to prevent or treat increased intracranial pressure icp and avoid neurological impairment  EOS increased icp is thought to result from restricted space for brain growth caused by decreased cranial vault volume  EOS a secondary surgical indication is normalization of head shape for cosmetic purposes  EOS literature is limited on the relationship between craniosynostosis and icp  EOS the most widely reported study is by renier and colleagues  EOS in patients preoperative icp monitoring was performed using an epidural sensor  EOS they identified icp to be normal in one third of the cases obviously elevated in one third and borderline in one third  EOS when counseling patients practitioners report a rate of increased icp for single suture synostosis and for multiple suture synostosis  EOS however the authors used adult normative values for icp normal less than mmhg and elevated greater than mmhg  EOS normal icp in children and infants has been identified to be closer to mmhg  EOS due to the invasiveness of the test preoperative icp monitoring is not routinely performed to decide if operative repair is required  EOS other indirect signs of increased intracranial pressure have been described e  EOSg  EOS copper beaten appearance of the skull on plain film papilledema comparing intracranial volume to normative data but are not reliable  EOS currently the standard of care is to surgically treat all patients with craniosynostosis  EOS while it is not currently feasible to measure icp directly we may be able to indirectly study the effects of growth restriction on brain development  EOS metabolic consequences of direct mechanical stress and global cerebral ischemia in craniosynostosis have not been described  EOS we aim to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic defects in craniosynostosis patients through the use of magnetic resonance mr imaging techniques  EOS up to twenty patients with craniosynostosis or other abnormalities such as hydrocephaly which are associated with increased cranial pressure will be enrolled in this pilot study  EOS the investigators will obtain several measures of cerebral metabolism preoperatively  EOS mr spectroscopy mrs will be used to obtain concentrations of n acetyl aspartate naa and lactate  EOS naa is a highly sensitive marker of brain injury and the presence of lactate can indicate compromised

be used  EOS the analysis for oef and asl data will be performed by dr  EOS dustin ragan and dr  EOS mckinstry at washington university in st  EOS louis  EOS,craniosynostosis is a birth defect that causes the bones on a baby s head to fuse together earlier than normal  EOS this causes the baby to have an abnormally shaped head  EOS these children are operated on to prevent or treat increased pressure on the brain allowing for normal development  EOS there is not good evidence of which children with craniosynostosis have increased pressure on the brain  EOS up to twenty patients with craniofacial abnormalities will be enrolled in this pilot study  EOS the investigators will use a magnetic resonance scanner to obtain several measures of brain metabolism  EOS the investigators will

background recent scientific evidence suggests that diets largely based on plant foods such as well balanced vegetarian diets have potential to improve health in contrast with predominantly meat based diets  EOS however many consumers may not wish to exclude meat from the diet despite current advice to reduce in particular processed meat  EOS one way to achieve this is to increase consumption of plant based protein components in the diet  EOS making a comparison of the nutritional content of high protein plants i  EOSe  EOS those with g protein g dry weight several candidate sources were identified  EOS in particular these belong to the fabaceae family and include pulses green peas fava beans lupin seeds and certain common bean species  EOS species from plant families other than the fabaceae generally have less protein  EOS an exception is hemp seed cannabaceae family which can have a protein content around g protein g dry weight is a source of fibre and has favourable fatty acid and amino acid profiles  EOS other families of interest include the amaranthaceae species quinoa polygonaceae buckwheat and the poaceae wheat barley and oats  EOS protein content of these pseudocereal and cereal crops ranges from g protein g dry weight  EOS although lower in protein content compared with the fabaceae species they are generally rich in fibre and consequently will impart additional benefits to a high protein plant based diet  EOS according to the scottish health survey nearly two thirds of men  EOS and approximately half of women  EOS were overweight  EOS obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic syndrome which is linked to conditions such as type ii diabetes mellitus t dm  EOS having impaired glucose tolerance doubles the chance of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease cvd  EOS cvd is the leading cause of death and accounts for nearly of deaths worldwide each year  EOS clinical studies have shown that regular consumption of pulses can reduce blood levels of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein ldl  EOS the recent meta analysis of randomized controlled trials provides the strongest evidence to date that non soya legume consumption lowers serum total and ldl cholesterol and therefore may lower the risk of cvd  EOS eating pulses regularly may also lower cvd risk via favorable effects on blood pressure blood glucose and insulin levels and by satisfying hunger and helping manage body weight  EOS higher legume intakes were associated with lower body mass index bmi blood pressure serum total cholesterol tc and a lower incidence of t dm compared with lower legume intakes  EOS in addition to achieving energy balance and improving the overall diet the world health organization who recommends that people increase consumption of legumes pulses as well as vegetables wholegrain and nuts to prevent obesity  EOS there does not seem to be differential effects of pea protein as compared to other meat and dairy proteins when fed at similar amounts as a pre load  EOS technically a nut hempseed typically contains over oil and about protein with considerable amounts of dietary fibre vitamins and minerals  EOS the two main proteins in hempseed are edestin and albumin high quality storage proteins are easily digested and contain nutritionally significant amounts of all essential amino acids hempseed has exceptionally high levels of the amino acid arginine  EOS hempseed is an excellent source of nutrition and has been used to treat various disorders for thousands of years in traditional medicine  EOS animal studies and only few humans study on hemp seeds oil agree as well that hempseed has health promoting properties supported by results from nutritional analyses of the seed oil and seed meal  EOS being a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids and proteins which contain all of the essential amino acids in nutritionally sufficient amounts as detailed by the fao who food and agriculture organization of the united nations world health organization suggested requirements for infants or children  EOS hemp proteins have a protein digestibility corrected amino acid score pdcaas equal to or greater than certain grains other nuts and some pulses  EOS hempseed in addition to its nutritional value has demonstrated positive health benefits including the lowering of cholesterol and high blood pressure  EOS buckwheat has attracted increasing attention from food scientists for its potential beneficial effects in chronic diseases  EOS in the early s the nutritional properties of buckwheat were first demonstrated  EOS the cholesterol lowering effects of buckwheat protein extracts in rats with cholesterol enriched diets has been reported  EOS there has been much research conducted on the functionalities and properties of buckwheat proteins and other phytochemicals in buckwheat seeds  EOS among them the most promising are the flavones flavonoids phytosterols fagopyrins and the thiamin binding proteins  EOS buckwheat proteins have unique amino acid compositions experiments both in animal models and with human studies revealed that buckwheat flour can improve t dm obesity hypertension hypercholesterolemia and constipation  EOS for the social science element of the project the proposed study will employ qualitative research methods which emphasise the importance of lay knowledge and the subjective experience of research participants  EOS within the field of nutrition research qualitative methods and techniques still remain comparatively rare  EOS this is partly because of the privileged status of quantitative research but also because of the length of time and amount of effort that goes into each qualitative study and the small pool of qualified researchers in this field  EOSas qualitative research efforts require that researchers seek to understand people and the social and cultural contexts in which they live from the participants points of view this type of knowledge has much to contribute to our understanding of why people eat what they do  EOS for the purposes of this study qualitative methods will enhance our understanding of the acceptability to consumers in scotland of foods based on sustainable plant based protein  EOS it will also tell us much about any barrier that exist to the uptake of such foods from a consumer perspective  EOS planned work for the study from a health perspective it is essential to establish the bioavailability and metabolism of plant proteins and other dietary constituents in humans  EOS certain metabolites are absorbed early in the gastrointestinal tract whereas others are transported to the colon where they are extensively metabolized by the gut microbiota  EOS in this acute study we will characterise the bioactive metabolites present in the urine and plasma samples obtained  EOS this will inform on their availability to the systemic circulation as well as their excretion profiles  EOS we will employ targeted quantitative analysis using both lc ms and gc ms which will provide the identity of metabolites and their in vivo concentrations  EOS we will focus on metabolites that are considered to impact on human health  EOS the principal metabolites analysed will be those produced by the phenylpropanoid pathway and products of protein and carbohydrate metabolism  EOS these will include derivatives and metabolites of the simple phenols benzoic acids phenolic acids phenylacetic acids phenypropionic acids phenylpyruvic acids phenyllactic acids mandellic acids phenolic dimers acetophenones benzaldehydes cinnamaldehydes benzyl alcohols cinnamyl alcohols indoles isoflavones coumarins chalcones flavanones flavones flavonols anthocyanidins  EOS we have also shown that many of these compounds are bioactive and exhibit anti oxidant and anti inflammatory activity at in vivo concentrations  EOS these studies will provide important information on bioavailability and metabolism but will also allow us to correlate the indices with biomarkers of health  EOS in this study we will also examine the effect of different protein sources on post prandial effects endocrine responses e  EOSg  EOS pyy peptide yy levels and hunger ratings  EOS the energy intake for each volunteer will be measured after lunch ad libitum on the intervention day  EOS volunteer views and acceptability towards diets rich in plant protein will be assessed  EOS some components in pulses may contribute to weight control by inhibiting intestinal absorption of carbohydrates and other energy yielding nutrients such as protein  EOS correlating the metabolic profiles with biomarkers of health will provide information that will be fed back into agricultural practice to optimise crop breeding strategies for benefits on human health  EOS with regard to the social science component of the project in depth semi structured interviews will be used  EOS the term semi structured reflects the intrinsic flexibility of qualitative interview approaches which often use an aide memoire or interview guide rather than a formal schedule  EOS in addition the form and content of the research questions is likely to vary in response to each particular interview context  EOS this type of built in design can strengthen qualitative research because of its attentiveness to context  EOS all interviews will be digitally recorded and fully transcribed  EOS the qualitative analytical techniques applied will look for and examine the themes and patterns of meaning within the kinds of data generated by this research mode  EOS the interviews and conversations that take place as part of qualitative inquiry will generate responses perceptions opinions and so on from research participants  EOS these can be understood as constituting a discourse or set of ideas derived from the focus of the inquiry that lends itself particularly well to thematic analysis  EOS themes are derived by the process known as coding or labelling specific chunks of text according to the ideas which they seem to represent  EOS this interpretative work involves the creation of analytical themes by the researcher and is particularly useful in bringing together the insider or emic perspective derived from the research participant s knowledge and experience with the outsider or etic perspective of the researcher and the relevant literature  EOS patterns in the data are thus identified through the intellectual work of bringing together components or fragments of ideas perceptions or experiences which might be meaningless when considered in isolation  EOS the researcher engaged in thematic analysis seeks to understand how different ideas or components fit together in a meaningful way in order to produce a coherent analytical account  EOS the analysis will be validated by referring back to the relevant literature which may support or counter inferences drawn by the researcher  EOS the interweaving of research findings with extant research literature will help strengthen the interpretive account provided by the researcher  EOS research participants will also be engaged in this process in that their feedback on emerging patterns will be sought  EOS this process of member checking will be conducted during the course of each interview  EOS through an analytical framework that focuses on discourse and acknowledges the importance of participants own perspectives and experiences analysis will present a contextualised exploration of the ways in which consumers perceive plant based proteins as alternatives or supplements to meat  EOS,summary this research will examine the nutritional effects of supplementing diets with alternative plant sources of protein with potential to be grown in scotland  EOS in particular we will assess the potential of these plant protein sources to complement diets in which the predominant source of protein is meat  EOS these protein sources will include plants from the fabaceae cannabaceae and polygonaceae families which could be used as the basis for the development of new foods  EOS the research will assess if these plant proteins can deliver a comparable alternative to meat based diets  EOS it is anticipated that the results could encourage increased consumption of plant products which would be favorable for consumers shifting away from animal derived proteins for health and or environmental reasons  EOS hypothesis consumption of protein rich plants could be a sustainable and healthy choice for partial replacement in

severe aplastic anemia saa is a life threatening blood disease that can be successfully treated with immunosuppressive drug regimens or allogeneic stem cell transplantation  EOS however of patients are ineligible for transplant due to lack of an appropriate donor age or comorbidities  EOS immunosuppression can be more broadly utilized but about of patients do not respond to a single course of horse atg and cyclosporine and have persistent severe cytopenias  EOS among patients who do respond to immunosuppression responses may be partial with persistent thrombocytopenia neutropenia and or anemia  EOS about of responding patients either relapse or are dependent on continued cyclosporine administration  EOS patients with refractory severe cytopenias are at risk of dying from infection or bleeding and they require regular platelet and or red blood cell transfusions which are expensive and inconvenient patients with refractory saa are also at risk for progression to other hematologic disorders including myelodysplasia and leukemia  EOS thrombopoietin tpo was first identified as the principal protein regulating platelet production and it stimulates the proliferation of megakaryocytes and release of platelets  EOS tpo was later shown to stimulate proliferation of more primitive bone marrow stem and progenitor cells in vitro and in animal models suggesting it could have an impact of production of red and white blood cells as well as platelets  EOS the nd generation oral small molecule tpo agonist eltrombopag promacta has been shown to increase platelets in healthy subjects and in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura itp and hepatitis c virus hcv infection  EOS eltrombopag has been well tolerated in clinical trials and unlike recombinant tpo it does not induce autoantibodies  EOS eltrombopag received fda accelerated approval on november for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids immunoglobulins or splenectomy  EOS in november fda approval was received for hepatitis c associated thrombocytopenia  EOS we conducted a pilot dose finding study in patients with severe aplastic anemia who had refractory thrombocytopenia following standard immunosuppressive therapy  EOS patients began at a dose of mg day and escalated every two weeks to a maximum dose of mg day  EOS we reported that of patients achieved hematological response in at least one lineage following weeks of dose escalating eltrombopag therapy with minimal toxicity  EOS responding patients as assessed at weeks were invited to continue on drug in an extension phase  EOS with a median follow up of months on drug eventually became tri lineage responders  EOS nine became transfusion independent for platelets median increase in platelet count micro l six had improved hemoglobin levels median increase of  EOS g dl including three previously dependent on red cell transfusions achieving transfusion independence and eight exhibiting increased neutrophil counts median increase cells mico l  EOS serial bone marrow biopsies demonstrated normalization of tri lineage hematopoiesis in responders without increased fibrosis  EOS in the previous study response assessment occurred at weeks and patients not fulfilling response criteria at that time had the drug discontinued  EOS several patients began to have detectable changes in transfusion requirements or blood counts by weeks but did not fulfill response criteria by that time point and therefore had to discontinue eltrombopag  EOS other patients who barely met response criteria at weeks showed very marked further improvements in blood counts in all lineages during the extension phase in some cases not reaching maximal responses until one year after initiating eltrombopag  EOS we hypothesize that a larger fraction of patients may respond if eltrombopag is continued for longer than weeks  EOS we therefore propose a follow up phase study giving eltrombopag treatment for weeks prior to definitive response assessment and initiating study medication at a fixed dose of mg day mg day for individuals of east asian ethnicity given lack of toxicity at that dose in the prior study and no evidence for response in any patient during dose escalation prior to reaching this dose  EOS responses will be assessed in all three lineages  EOS subjects with platelet red cell and or neutrophil responses at weeks may continue study medication extended access until they meet off study criteria  EOS the primary objective is to assess the efficacy of months of eltrombopag administration in improving bone marrow function in saa patients with persistent severe cytopenias refractory to treatment with immunosuppressive treatment  EOS secondary objectives include assessment of relapse or clonal evolution pre treatment characteristics predicting response and the impact of treatment and treatment response on quality of life  EOS,background eltrombopag is a drug being tested for treating severe aplastic anemia  EOS it can help improve blood counts in these patients  EOS however researchers do not know how long the drug can and should be taken for this type of anemia  EOS objectives to look at whether months of treatment with eltrombopag can improve patient s blood counts  EOS eligibility individuals at least years of age who are taking eltrombopag for severe aplastic anemia  EOS design participants will take eltrombopag by mouth once a day for months  EOS blood samples will be collected every weeks for the first months  EOS bone marrow samples will be collected at and months  EOS these samples will look at the effects of the study drug on the marrow  EOS participants will continue to take the study drug for as long as it is effective and if the side effects are not severe  EOS

the small airways are gaining greater recognition for their role in the pathophysiology of persistent asthma and as a relevant target for asthma treatment  EOS pathological abnormalities in the small airways have been demonstrated regardless of asthma severity and seem to persist even in patients with stable asthma  EOS historically the small airways have been difficult to assess  EOS spirometry generally reflects large airways function although the mean forced expiratory flow fef between and of fvc fef has been used to assess small airway obstruction  EOS more recently impulse oscillometry ios has been used to assess the role of small airways in asthma  EOS ios is an effort independent test using oscillation of differing sound waves to derive a variety of output measurements determining both the degree of total and peripheral airway resistance  EOS resistance at hz reflects total airway resistance and central airway resistance is approximated using resistance at hz r  EOS the peripheral or small airway component can thus be evaluated by calculating the difference between these two measurements i  EOSe  EOS r r  EOS we have identified from our database of primary care referrals a cohort of patients who appear to have evidence of an unmet physiological need in terms of persistent small airways dysfunction on the basis of impairment of r and r r despite taking step asthma treatment  EOS approximately of patients across steps had severely abnormal values for both r r  EOS kpa l  EOSs and r  EOS such small airway dysfunction at step occurred despite patients being prescribed ics with laba although there were no patients being prescribed extra fine ics laba or extra fine laba i  EOSe  EOS fostair or atimos  EOS in terms of the ics moiety observational data has shown that patients taking extra fine hfa beclometasone solution qvar have equal or better control than those taking fluticasone suspension while receiving a lower maintenance dose of ics  EOS in another study patients switched from beclometasone suspension to solution at half the dose had an improvement in asthma quality of life  EOS in neither of these studies was there any information available regarding small airway dysfunction in order to explain the potential improvements with hfa beclometasone  EOS there is a paucity of information on the potential benefits of extra fine formoterol on the small airways  EOS in a single dosing study comparing extra fine hfa versus coarse particle dry powder formulations of formoterol there was a difference absolute difference of  EOS kpa l  EOSs  EOSmin in r auc min and difference absolute difference of  EOS kpa l  EOSs  EOSmin in r r auc min although this was not the primary end point  EOS  EOS rationale thus the primary objective for the present study is to compare the two extremes of available long acting beta agonist formulations i  EOSe  EOS extra fine hfa formoterol atimos versus coarse particle dpi salmeterol i  EOSe  EOS serevent accuhaler  EOS if there turns out to be a significant improvement in small airways function conferred by extra fine formoterol then this would in turn support the rationale for performing a further chronic study to assess the clinical impact of treating persistent small airways dysfunction at step by switching patients to fostair hfa and comparing to seretide dpi in terms of improving asthma control in patients with the small airway phenotype who are already taking conventional ics laba formulations  EOS we will use impulse oscillometry to assess the small airways response using the difference between resistance measured at hz and hz r r as the primary outcome  EOS in this regard we have previously reported in asthmatic patients receiving propranolol that there was a  EOS ci  EOS  EOS worsening of r r in terms of the bronchoconstrictor response to propranolol and following subsequent histamine challenge there was a  EOS ci  EOS  EOS improvement in r r in terms of the bronchodilator response to nebulised salbutamol  EOS,the airways in the lungs get smaller the further into the lungs they go  EOS most simple measurements of lung function only reflect the larger central airways and do not provide information on the smaller peripheral airways  EOS newer measurements have been developed that can now give us accurate information on how the smaller airways are working  EOS indeed the small airways seem to play a significant role in asthma in terms of inflammation and airway narrowing  EOS recently new types of inhaler formulations have been developed that have a much smaller particle size than other standard formulations  EOS these formulations have been shown to go further into the lungs thus getting into the smaller airways  EOS in this study we aim to compare the two extremes of available long acting beta agonists in terms of particle size i  EOSe  EOS extra fine formoterol atimos versus coarse particle salmeterol serevent in asthmatics with abnormal small airway function using a breathing test called impulse oscillometry  EOS by using this test we will be able to find out whether using an extrafine particle inhaler improves small airway function  EOS

background coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery is commonly performed in the nhs and worldwide based on historical evidence of benefit over medical therapy and more recent evidence of benefit over percutaneous coronary intervention pci  EOS according to the national audit data from the society of cardiothoracic surgeons and the british cardiovascular intervention society over million cabg operations have been performed in the uk with operations performed annually since  EOS although the number of isolated cabg operations performed annually has fallen slightly e  EOSg  EOS in cabg combined with valve surgery has increased  EOS since the year survival rate after cabg is approximately several hundred thousand patients with prior cabg are likely alive in the uk  EOS however occlusive vein graft disease affects around of patients within months of surgery and affects at least two thirds of patients by years  EOS furthermore disease in the native coronary arteries may also deteriorate  EOS consequently even though vein graft occlusion may initially be subclinical angina eventually recurs in most patients with repeat revascularisation almost always by pci required in nearly two thirds of patients by years  EOS furthermore when pci is performed in these patients clinical outcomes in the longer term are poor because of restenosis  EOS given the large number of cabg survivors in the uk and the complexities of their clinical management their cardiac morbidity and mortality is an increasing challenge in nhs hospitals  EOS chest pain is the commonest reason for hospital admission in the uk and more than in hospital admissions with suspected acute myocardial infarction mi have a history of prior cabg and non st elevation acute coronary syndrome nste acs patients with prior cabg spend more time in hospital than those without a history of cabg  EOS according to the myocardial ischaemia national audit project minap patients were admitted with an nste acs in england and wales during including approximately patients with prior cabg  EOS the median day death rate of all nste acs patients in the uk in was approximately  EOS and clinical outcomes in cabg patients are much worse than in patients without prior cabg  EOS however since prior cabg status is not an independent predictor of mortality the prognostic determinants are multifactorial and strongly influenced by age and co morbidity  EOS there is an important lack of evidence to inform clinical decision making in symptomatic cabg patients hospitalised with nste acs  EOS firstly most clinical trials of treatment strategies in acs have excluded patients with prior cabg  EOS the pivotal clinical trials which specifically compared invasive versus conservative management in unstable coronary syndromes including thrombolysis in myocardial infarction timi iiib fragmin during instability in coronary artery disease frisc ii treat angina with aggrastat and determine the cost of therapy with an invasive or conservative strategy tactics timi and randomized intervention treatment of angina rita excluded patients with prior cabg meaning evidence is lacking on which treatment strategy is most appropriate in this patient group  EOS in the absence of trial data guidelines for clinicians are based on observational studies a subgroup analysis and expert opinion level of evidence c  EOS according to the uk national institute of clinical excellence nice clinical guideline in the absence of more research consensus expert opinion is the best that can be achieved  EOS although cabg patients with acute ischaemia are often managed invasively angiography commonly does not lead to revascularisation  EOS pci or even repeat cabg is technically challenging complications are common and longer term outcomes are poor  EOS this is especially the case for repeat pci in vein grafts  EOS overall invasive management of patients with prior cabg is technically challenging and health outcomes are influenced by the effectiveness of the procedure and complications safety  EOS procedural success is harder to achieve because of advanced native coronary and graft disease and co morbidity meaning the procedure is less often a success and the risks of complications and adverse events e  EOSg  EOS stroke are three four fold higher than average  EOS since the internal mammary graft is almost always patent redo surgery is rarely performed because sternotomy may damage the mammary graft which can be a life threatening complication and current guidelines recommend pci unless the mammary graft is occluded  EOS the effectiveness of a routine invasive approach in every day clinical practice which is the approach of many clinicians is called into question because acute and long term outcomes are much worse than in patients without prior cabg  EOS pci in redo cabg carries a four fold higher risk of death compared to the index procedure and complications associated with pci include bleeding stroke and contrast nephropathy  EOS redo cabg confers a much higher risk than percutaneous coronary intervention pci  EOS overall increased age and co morbidity are common and key drivers of long term outcome  EOS outcomes after pci in vein grafts or native vessel disease are poor  EOS for example in wales of patients who had pci after cabg adverse cardiac events occurred in of them by months mainly related to repeat pci  EOS in the uk overall of pcis performed in  EOS were performed in patients with prior cabg  EOS only in procedures were reported as successful and  EOS and  EOS of patients experienced in hospital mi or death  EOS ten years on  EOS of all patients undergoing pci had a history of prior cabg and procedure related outcomes remained disappointingly similar in procedures unsuccessful in hospital death rate  EOS day mortality  EOS  EOS by contrast the efficacy of contemporary optimal medical therapies in patients with prior cabg is at least as good as in patients without prior cabg  EOS furthermore medical therapy is not associated with procedure related complications and potentially may be safer than invasive management  EOS in contrast to revascularisation trials patients with prior cabg are usually not excluded from contemporary drug trials e  EOSg  EOS plato and the evidence for secondary prevention medical therapies in patients with prior cabg is reasonably robust  EOS in fact some therapeutic trials have specifically focused on post cabg patients and have shown that statin therapy attenuates graft disease progression and improves patient outcomes  EOS in acs patients with prior cabg health outcomes are also improved by treatment with contemporary anti platelet drug therapies  EOS new evidence based medicines continue to emerge including more potent anti platelet drugs such as ticagrelor and prasugrel and safer anti coagulants such as fondaparinux  EOS our strategy is also predicated on use of optimal anti ischaemic therapies including novel drugs such as ivabradine as clinically appropriate  EOS practices and uncertainities associated with management of cabg patients with acute ischemia since most patients with prior cabg and an acute nste acs will be intermediate high risk most patients will be considered for invasive management according to guideline recommendations  EOS registries indicate that invasive management only occurs in about half of these patients in the uk and abroad and revascularisation only occurs in about half of those who have angiography  EOS in fact prior cabg status is an independent predictor against invasive management  EOS use of evidence based drug therapies such as aspirin clopidogrel ticagrelor is lower in acs patients with prior cabg compared to in patients without prior cabg despite the fact clinical trial results suggest these drugs improve outcomes substantially in patients with prior cabg  EOS issues around the study patient population the study population will involve patients with an established history of coronary heart disease who have had previous cabg  EOS typically cabg patients who are readmitted to hospital with recurrent angina or myocardial infarction do so at least one year after the operation and usually years afterwards  EOS therefore these patients are usually familiar with the hospital environment and will always have had a coronary angiogram in the past since this is a requirement before cabg  EOS furthermore many e  EOSg  EOS at least one quarter of these patients will have had an angioplasty in the past too  EOS some of these patients will have had angiograms and angioplasty procedures after the cabg also  EOS issues relating to acute coronary syndrome we will recruit patients with unstable angina or a non st elevation acute coronary syndrome nste acs  EOS these patients usually have a history of self limiting chest pain  EOS usually the pain is controlled by initial medical therapy and these patients routinely wait on hospital cardiology wards often days at a time for an in patient coronary graft angiogram  EOS sometimes the angiography is deferred as an out patient  EOS occasionally angina recurs at rest or with minimal exertion refractory ischaemia and angiography is expedited  EOS in the vast majority of patients there will be ample time minimum h usually h as appropriate to discuss the patient information sheet and obtain informed consent  EOS management strategies clinical guidelines from nice and the european society of cardiology recognise that there is no evidence base to instructively inform the management of these patients thus patient and clinician preference usually inform decision making  EOS in this trial patients who are invited to participate should be eligible for either treatment option  EOS in this trial the type of treatment in each strategy medical or invasive will be as per current practice in the nhs and there will be no additional study interventions  EOS usual care diagnostic tests including non invasive stress testing and ct angiography may be performed if requested by the attending clinician but these tests cannot influence the treatment group assignment of randomised patients  EOS hospital type a group of hospitals will be included that provide different forms of clinical services  EOS the city hospitals in this trial will be the western infirmary and glasgow royal infirmary  EOS the district hospitals will be the royal alexandra hospital and royal blackburn hospital  EOS one of the hospitals will have on site admission and catheterisation facilities the royal blackburn hospital and the other hospitals participate in a regional model of care with transfer for invasive management to the regional cardiothoracic centre the golden jubilee national hospital  EOS the standard clinical referral pathway in the nhs will be used in this trial  EOS objective of the pilot to prospectively gather information on about screening recruitment randomisation and initial clinical outcomes  EOS other than the randomisation to either medical or invasive management the trial will essentially be observational  EOS recruitment will take place during routine clinical care and will be lead by the attending clinicians who are responsible for the patients rather than being lead by a research team  EOS objective of the registry to understand the characteristics of nste acs patients with prior cabg who do not take part in the randomised trial  EOS the reasons for not participating may be due to the presence of exclusion characteristics patient preference or physician preference  EOS this information will be very important to understand feasibility and also whether or not our trial will

histologically proven diagnosis of a nonhematopoietic malignancy  EOS patients must be classified as rtog rpa class i or rpa class ii  EOS introduction  EOS adverse effects of whole brain radiotherapy wbrt whole brain radiotherapy wbrt remains the standard treatment approach for patients with multiple brain metastases  EOS wbrt has been shown to achieve rapid palliation of neurological symptoms and improves overall survival compared to corticosteroids alone for patients with multiple brain metastases  EOS additionally adjuvant wbrt has been shown to improve local control and time to neurocognitive function decline in patients with limited to brain metastases that are treated with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery  EOS despite significant technical advances in radiation delivery and increased survival in tumors that demonstrate sensitivity to systemic therapies conventional wbrt has not materially changed in the past years  EOS conventional wbrt is generally well tolerated save for alopecia fatigue and short term neurocognitive decline in patients with a short life expectancy months  EOS in a recent randomized trial at md anderson wbrt after srs increased the risk of neurocognitive decline points as assessed by the hopkins verbal learning test at months after treatment compared to srs alone vs  EOS p  EOS  EOS in other studies development of subsequent brain metastases are a significant contributor to cognitive decline  EOS in long term survivors months irreversible neurocognitive decline has been reported in up to of patients treated with conventional wbrt although this study utilized daily radiation doses gy per day that are no longer in common use  EOS the decline in cognitive function assessed by mini mental status examination may take up to years to manifest  EOS extensive research has investigated methods of improving the efficacy of wbrt  EOS this included increasing the radiation dose hyperfractionated radiation schedules and combining wbrt with drug therapy  EOS currently the standard wbrt radiation dose schedule is to  EOS gy in to fractions  EOS one promising approach to improve local control and survival has been combining wbrt with stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with to metastases  EOS an emerging strategy to reduce the toxicity of wbrt is to administer surgery or srs alone for patients with limited brain metastases  EOS although this results in a higher risk of brain relapse some of these recurrences can be salvaged with repeat srs and or wbrt  EOS for the majority of patients with brain metastases who require wbrt little research has focused on improving the therapeutic ratio of wbrt by reducing its toxicity  EOS  EOS rationale for selective targeting of brain metastases in wbrt in general radiation oncologists approach patients by selectively targeting the gross tumor plus margin for microscopic extension and setup uncertainty to the prescription dose while administering a lower dose to areas of subclinical risk  EOS this strategy is extensively utilized in brain head and neck lung gastrointestinal breast gynecologic hematologic and genitourinary tumors  EOS in many centers over half of the patients are treated with imrt to improve dose distributions to increase efficacy and or reduce toxicity  EOS despite the critical physiological role played by the uninvolved brain the reason this paradigm has not been extended to wbrt likely relates to the general poor prognosis of patients with brain metastases with a median survival of months  EOS selectively targeting brain metastases requires more physician physicist and radiation therapist effort and the investment of increased resources and cost of treatment for this patient population may be unjustified unless the improved dose distribution translates into significant clinical benefit  EOS in the era of accountable care determining the cost effectiveness of imrt vs  EOS conventional wbrt is necessary  EOS the recent identification of long term survivors of metastatic cancer treated with more effective local and systemic therapies is slowly changing these attitudes  EOS there are distinct subgroups of patients with brain metastases with a more reasonable prognosis  EOS for instance rtog recursive partitioning analysis rpa group patients have a median survival of months  EOS patients with single brain metastases undergoing surgery followed by wbrt have a median survival of months  EOS a recent study from japan further classified rtog rpa class ii to class iia iib and iic based on the presence of favorable factors including performance status number of brain tumors primary tumor controlled or active and extracranial metastases  EOS survival for patients with rpa class iia iib and iic was to months months and to months respectively with long term survivors in each subgroup  EOS there have been preliminary efforts to apply imrt to improve whole brain radiation  EOS this concept was first proposed by kao et al in  EOS two avenues of research were proposed  EOS one approach is to selectively spare parts of the brain that are critical for neurocognitive function such as the hippocampal stem cells in the subgranular zone  EOS this approach has been extensively tested by investigators at the university of wisconsin  EOS the risk of brain metastases in the hippocampal avoidance zone is less than  EOS rtog is an ongoing phase ii trial testing imrt wbrt to a total dose of gy in fractions while limiting the mean hippocampal avoidance zone dose to less than gy  EOS the major criticism of this approach is that the hippocampal avoidance zone is only one of several regions of the brain are involved with memory processing and retention  EOS using the rtog technique potentially functional brain tissue including the limbic circuit and neural stem cell region will receive the full prescription dose even if clinically uninvolved with metastases  EOS pending further study this approach remains experimental and should not be performed outside the context of controlled clinical trials  EOS a second strategy is to selectively boost areas of gross disease while simultaneously treating the uninvolved brain with standard radiation doses  EOS this strategy is currently being tested in countries with socialized health systems such as the united kingdom and canada as a cost effective alternative to stereotactic radiosurgery boost  EOS a published report from england reported the feasibility of treating gross tumors to gy in fractions while treating the uninvolved brain to gy in fractions  EOS a third application of whole brain radiation is selective sparing of the scalp  EOS the clinical target is the whole brain but unintended radiation to the scalp can result in temporary or permanent alopecia  EOS due to the dose distribution of conventional wbrt the vertex of the scalp receives a particularly high dose  EOS preliminary work suggests that imrt can limit the mean scalp dose to to gy and these reduced doses may shorten the duration of temporary alopecia and possibly reduce the risk of permanent alopecia  EOS a final strategy has not yet been explored  EOS rather than increasing the dose of radiation to the identified brain tumors we can reduce the dose to the uninvolved brain to reduce acute and long term side effects  EOS in the setting of prophylactic wbrt for small cell and non small cell lung cancer lower radiation doses of to gy in to fractions are considered standard treatment  EOS in a randomized trial of prophylactic cranial irradiation for small cell lung cancer there was no evidence of improved disease control with gy vs  EOS gy  EOS with the exception of a single report demonstrating subtle effects on neurocognitive function as assessed by hopkins verbal learning test there is little evidence that wbrt to to gy in to fractions results in neurocognitive decline with prophylactic wbrt vs  EOS observation in multiple randomized controlled trials  EOS higher doses of wbrt have been shown to reduce verbal memory function  EOS additionally there are robust data from randomized trials reproducibly demonstrating a significant reduction in the incidence of subsequent brain metastases in regions of the brain with no dominant mass appreciable on mri prior to treatment  EOS a theoretical disadvantage of limiting wbrt to gy in fractions is that this dose may be inadequate to prevent relapse in relatively radioresistant tumors  EOS however as discussed earlier some investigators are now administering gy to uninvolved sites by deferring wbrt due to concerns of toxicity  EOS  EOS feasibility of selective avoidance of uninvolved brain and scalp during imrt based on this body of published evidence we started utilizing imrt for selected patients with brain metastases in june  EOS our planning objectives are to deliver  EOS gy in fractions to the gross tumor s mm margin while limiting radiation dose to gy  EOS a secondary goal is to limit the mean scalp dose to to gy  EOS no effort was made to achieve additional sparing of the hippocampal stem cells since definitive data demonstrating a benefit has not yet been published  EOS based on the feasibility and promising preliminary experience we propose a prospective randomized trial to determine whether there are significant benefits for wbrt delivered via imrt  EOS  EOS neurocognitive function and quality of life assessment although more extensive and sensitive neurocognitive tests such as the hopkins verbal learning test are available in the context of resources available to a high quality community hospital program we will limit our neurocognitive function assessment to serial mini mental status examinations  EOS mini mental status examination mmse is the most widely used global mental status measure in medical settings and requires less than minutes to complete  EOS this assessment tool has been extensively validated in nearly patients with brain tumors treated on rtog protocols  EOS quality of life will be assessed using the eortc qlq bn which is an extensively validated one page patient reported survey of questions  EOS the eortc qlq bn is designed for use with patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy and is composed of questions assessing visual disorders motor dysfunction communication deficit various disease symptoms eg headaches and seizures treatment toxicities eg hair loss and future uncertainty  EOS the eortc qlq bn has robust psychometric properties resulting from rigorous testing development and external validity  EOS within weeks prior to wbrt all patients will undergo a baseline quality of life assessment  EOS after completion wbrt all patients will undergo quality of life assessments every months for months and then every months after whole brain radiotherapy  EOS quality of life assessments will be scored by a blinded reviewer to avoid potential bias  EOS  EOS summary in summary preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that radiation dose received by uninvolved portions of the brain during wbrt plays a critical role in causing radiation induced alopecia and neurocognitive decline without improving survival  EOS extensive data from randomized trials suggests a benefit in reduced brain relapse from elective treatment of uninvolved brain  EOS although other approaches are being pursued reducing the radiation dose to levels utilized for prophylactic cranial irradiation is an attractive alternative to conventional wbrt that non specifically irradiates the entire brain or eliminating wbrt entirely  EOS we hypothesize that imrt wbrt will reduce the incidence and duration of alopecia while reducing the incidence of neurocognitive deficit to the acceptable levels observed in prophylactic cranial irradiation  EOS,in this study the patient will receive either whole brain radiation therapy given by intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt or standard conventional radiation  EOS in imrt therapy radiation dose to the parts of the brain that do not contain tumors is reduced  EOS this study will look to see if this approach results in less hair loss or fewer memory problems as compared to the standard technique  EOS the study will also look at the effectiveness of both techniques in controlling the growth of the tumor  EOS

under control  EOS increasing strengths of steroid inhaler may be required in order to gain control of asthma and this is usually guided both by symptoms and simple measurements of lung function such as peak flow  EOS the airways breathing tubes in the lungs get smaller the further into the lungs they go  EOS most simple measurements of lung function only reflect the larger central airways and don t provide information on the smaller peripheral airways  EOSnewer measurements have been developed that can now give us accurate information on how the smaller airways are working  EOSindeed the small airways seem to play a significant role in asthma in terms of inflammation and airway narrowing  EOS recently new types of steroid inhalers have been developed that have a much smaller particle size than other standard inhaled steroids  EOSthese have been shown to go deeper into the lungs thus getting into the smaller airways  EOS there have been a few studies suggesting that this might improve asthma control  EOS however we do not know if when small airway function is shown to be abnormal whether this improves with extra fine particle inhaled steroids nor whether by improving small airway function specifically this translates into improved asthma control  EOS in this study we wish to study asthmatic patients who are not completely controlled on standard particle size inhaled steroids in addition to having evidence of abnormal small airway function  EOS by doing this we want to find out whether changing to the same dose of an extra fine particle inhaled steroid instead will improve asthma control by getting deeper into the lungs and improving small airway function  EOS

of the sympathetic outflow of the spinal cord causes vasodilation and is one cause of this hypotension  EOS the higher the spread of the blockade will result in a higher incidence of hypotension  EOS injected hyperbaric medication has about minutes to spread within the intrathecal space before it will be taken up by the nerve roots  EOS the time that a patient remains in one position after medication injection will affect the spread of the resultant anesthetic block  EOS a patient who is left sitting for a longer period of time after injection of hyperbaric medication will have a lower

EOS tetanus based mcc vaccines mcc tt not only improve the immunogenicity of the hib component of combination vaccines tables but also result in higher menc primary and booster responses compared with mcc crm vaccines under the uk accelerated immunisation schedule southern et al  EOS kitchin et al  EOS  EOS if given with a concomitant mcc tt containing vaccine therefore infanrix hexa may provide a better hib antibody response under the uk month schedule  EOS neisvac c is the only available mcc tt vaccine and has been shown to be adequately immunogenic when given as a single dose at months of age with pediacel dtap hib ipv vaccine findlow et al  EOS  EOS use of a single dose of the combined mcc tt hib tt vaccine menitorix currently used for the routine month booster in the uk would be an attractive alternative  EOS although menitorix contains less menc antigen in the vaccine and therefore may not induce as good a post primary antibody response as a single dose of neisvac c or possibly even menjugate antibody response to the routine month booster dose of menitorix is likely to be satisfactory and may be better than the booster response in those primed with menjugate findlow et al  EOS  EOS the aim of this study therefore is to evaluate the immunogenicity of infanrix hexa when given at a month schedule with pcv at months and incorporating a random study of three different mcc vaccines menjugate neisvac c and menitorix given at months of age  EOS,in the uk infants currently receive a in vaccine pediacel at and months of age which protects against diphtheria tetanus pertussis whooping cough polio and haemophilus influenzae type b hib  EOS infants also routinely receive a meningococcal group c vaccine menc at and months and a valent pneumococcal vaccine prevenar at and months of age  EOS this study aims to offer infants a in vaccine infanrix hexa that also helps protect against hepatitis b alongside the other routine vaccinations in the uk infant immunisation schedule and assess their immune responses to the different vaccines  EOS hepatitis b virus infects the liver and usually affects adults but children can be infected through close contact with carriers of the virus  EOS children with hepatitis b infection may not have symptoms for many years but may go on to develop liver failure cirrhosis and cancer  EOS many other countries already use infanrix hexa and this study is being undertaken to help decide whether the uk can do the same  EOS babies taking part in this study will receive infanrix hexa instead of pediacel  EOS all other vaccines given will be the same as in the routine schedule but will include one menc vaccine instead of doses because the uk infant immunisation schedule is soon going to change so that all babies will receive only one menc vaccine at months of age  EOS there are currently several licensed menc vaccines that can be given to babies  EOS in order to check whether there are differences in protection babies taking part will randomly receive one of menc containing vaccines neisvacc menjugate or menitorix  EOS studies have already shown that one dose of neis vac or menjugate given to babies at months provides similar protection against menc infection as two doses given at and months  EOS menitorix protects against both hib and menc so babies in the group receiving menitorixtm will have an extra dose of hib which is also included in infanrix hexa but might have a lower antibody response to menc compared to the other two menc vaccines although all infants should be well protected after their month booster vaccinations which also contain menitorix  EOS

underserved communities of color in low income largely ethnic minority neighborhoods face an excessive burden of illness from depression due to higher prevalence of depression and lower access to quality care  EOS evidence based quality improvement qi programs for depression in primary care settings where many low income and minority patients receive their only mental health care can enhance quality of depression care and improve health outcomes  EOS these programs are under utilized in community based health care settings and have not been adapted for use across diverse agencies social service faith based primary and specialty care that could partner to support disease management for depression  EOS partners in care pic and we care are interventions designed to improve access to evidence based depression treatments medication management or psychotherapy for primary care patients and in we care social service clients  EOS pic evaluated a services delivery intervention while we care was an effectiveness trial with study provided treatments  EOS both studies promoted use of the same evidence based treatments  EOS both pic and we care programs improved use of evidence based treatments for depression and health outcomes for african americans and latinos  EOS the pic interventions reduced health outcome disparities evident in usual care in the first follow up year and at five year follow up  EOS while these findings offer hope to underserved communities such communities have poor resources to support implementation of these programs and may have historical distrust in research and health care settings  EOS there is no evidence based approach to support agency networks in underserved communities in implementing qi programs for depression  EOS to address this information gap investigators created community partners in care cpic a group level randomized controlled trial with randomization at the level of an agency site or unit  EOS the trial is being

reduce health and social disparities and ultimately achieve public health impact  EOS study findings will be disseminated widely using traditional academic community valued and policy relevant dissemination channels  EOS,cpic is a community initiative and research study funded by the nih  EOS cpic was developed and is being run by community and academic partners in los angeles underserved communities of color  EOS cpic compares two ways of supporting diverse health and social programs in under resourced communities to improve their services to depressed clients  EOS one approach is time limited expert technical assistance coupled with culturally competent community outreach to individual programs on how to use quality improvement toolkits for depression that have already been proven to be effective or helpful in primary care settings but adapted for this study for use in diverse community based programs in underserved communities  EOS the other approach brings different types of agencies and members in a community together in a to month planning process to fit the same depression quality improvement programs to the needs and strengths of the community and to develop a network of programs serving the community to support clients with depression together  EOS the study is designed to determine the added value of community engagement and planning over and above what might be offered through a community oriented disease management company  EOS both intervention models are based on the same quality improvement toolkits that support team leadership care management cognitive behavioral therapy medication management and patient education and activation  EOS investigators hypothesized that the community engagement approach would increase agency and clinician participation in evidence based trainings and improve client mental health related quality of life  EOS in addition during the design phase community participants prioritized adding as outcomes indicators of social determinants of mental health including physical functioning risk factors for homelessness and employment  EOS investigators hypothesized by activating community agencies that can address health and social services needs to engage depressed clients these outcomes would also be improved more in the collaboration condition  EOS investigators also hypothesized that the

fractures of the calcaneus comprise of all adult fractures  EOS these fractures make up of all tarsal injuries the majority of which are closed displaced intra articular fractures  EOS despite the injury s prevalence dispute over the appropriate method of treatment remains ongoing  EOS several studies have shown that an open surgical approach is superior to either a non surgical or percutaneous approach with regard to restoring proper alignment and structure of the hindfoot depending on the severity of the displacement and provided that certain patient conditions do not preclude surgery  EOS adequately restoring hindfoot structure is paramount to good clinical outcome not only is proper alignment integral for fully recovering physiological functionality but also in preventing further complications such as subtalar arthritis that present commonly in malunited calcaneal fractures  EOS though literature may show that open reduction and internal fixation orif techniques provide a better long term outcome of severely displaced intra articular fractures proponents of both non surgical and percutaneous approaches argue that the superiority of the outcome may be mitigated by the fact that open surgical procedures are laden post operatively with numerous wound complications  EOS these complications include but are not limited to both deep and superficial infections resulting in slough dehiscence necrosis and erythema in and around the surgical site  EOS managing infections of the surrounding soft tissue and vasculature of the calcaneus following operative treatment indeed seems to present a great challenge to treating physicians with wound healing complications present in of cases  EOS a necessity for surgical wound repair is adequately vascularized tissue which can be difficult to come by during closure of the wound due to the undermining and displacement of soft tissue during surgery  EOS sufficiently perfused soft tissue can also be difficult to differentiate from tissues that are inadequately vascular based on traditional clinical criteria such as color warmth and dermal bleeding  EOS the degree of this avascularity can depend on many factors relating to the patient necessitating studies be conducted identifying what factors place a prospective patient at a higher risk for developing wound healing problems post operatively  EOS studies of this nature thus far have noted that factors such as age sex height weight bohler s angle tobacco usage and pre existing conditions such as diabetes vascular disease and immune deficiencies may be indicative of increased likelihood for developing post surgical complications  EOS another risk factor of particular interest is the timing of surgery after the incidence of injury  EOS current literature regarding treatment of hindfoot injuries shows a moderate degree of uniformity advocating a delay in operative measures until the soft tissue swelling around the injury has had time to subside a window of approximately days after injury  EOS additionally in their investigation of bohler s angle as a predictor for wound healing complications shuler and colleagues noted the pre and post operative bohler s angle differential to be a significant predictor of developing infections postulating that the increase in heel height during surgery may concomitantly increase soft tissue tension substantially enough to disrupt proper blood supply to the surgical site during healing  EOS these findings lend tremendous support to the idea that blood perfusion in soft tissue plays a significant role in predicting wound healing complications  EOS however to our knowledge the use of angiography to correlate pre and post operative soft tissue perfusion patterns with post operative complication in patients undergoing orif of fractured calcanei has never been investigated  EOS indocyanine green icg angiography has been utilized in a myriad of other fields of medicine to evaluate perfusion in different tissues  EOS it has been used in cardiac surgery to asses bypass patency in microsurgery to assist in free tissue transfers and in plastic surgery to assess areas of future necrosis during mastectomy operations  EOS recently icg angiography has been used in general surgery to detect ischemic tissues and aid surgeons in determining the appropriate extent of debridement necessary prior to wound closure in laparotomy procedures  EOS though its utility in other disciplines of medicine are currently being further developed and understood the implications of icg angiography in orthopaedic surgery have gone unrecognized  EOS we postulate that soft tissue perfusion patterns elucidated by icg angiography in the heels of patients that have incurred calcaneal fractures may be predictive of wound healing complications that develop after surgery  EOS this information could allow surgeons to greatly reduce the complication rate of open reduction procedures on calcaneus fractures by early utilization of appropriate patient specific prophylactic measures and could provide an additional contraindication to this operation for patients whom otherwise were not aware they are at an elevated risk  EOS	researchers in the orthopaedic surgery department at lsu medical center shreveport hope to learn if patterns of blood flow around the incision site of patients undergoing surgery for heel bone fractures can help predict whether complications will arise after a specific type of operation  EOSthe goals of this research study are to effectively answer as many of the following research questions as possible  EOS can a drug normally used to evaluate adequate blood flow in plastic surgery and tissue transfer be used to identify altered patterns of blood flow at the operative site of calcaneus fractures when compared to the uninjured extremity ?  EOS are changes in blood flow identifiable at the operative site post operatively ?  EOS are there certain patterns of blood flow present preoperatively or postoperatively that can predict wound complication ?  EOS can certain patterns of blood flow predict the location of slough or dehiscence after surgery ?  EOS does the incision site and its proximity to specific patterns of blood flow possibly predict wound complication ? the hypothesis is that the study drug will show a correlation between certain patterns of blood flow and whatever post operative complications may arise  EOS
age related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries  EOS geographic atrophy is the advanced form of dry age related macular degeneration and currently has no effective therapy  EOS little is known about the risk factors that drive the progression of geographic atrophy and yet they are crucial to understand the mechanisms of the disease  EOS therefore the identification of risk factors associated with a faster spread of atrophy may help contribute to identify the causes of the disease and ultimately to develop new therapeutic strategies to manage the disorder  EOS the current prospective observational natural history study has the following objectives describe the natural history of geographic atrophy in anatomic and visual terms identify risk factors associated with a faster enlargement of atrophy the main hypothesis is that lipofuscin accumulation at the borders of atrophy as seen with fundus autofluorescence imaging is associated with a faster progression of the disease  EOS	age related macular degeneration is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide  EOS the factors that induce the progression of geographic atrophy the advanced form of dry age related macular degeneration remain poorly understood  EOS the aims of this study are to describe the natural history of geographic atrophy and identify potential risk factors associated with a faster spread of atrophy that may be used to develop rational therapies  EOS
the value of stan st analysis was assessed in randomized trials and shows a reduction in the incidence of severe hypoxia in fetuses during labor and a reduction in frequency of redemption with suction and caesarean section due to lack of oxygen during the birth process  EOS within the last year however there is substantial new information regarding  EOS stan  EOS the swedish social board has published a newsletter which describes a possible risk of birth of asphyxiated children some died and others have cerebral palsy  EOS a new finnish study suggests that there may be an increased risk of moderate acidosis after using stan  EOS the above has led to considerable debate not just in sweden but also throughout europe  EOS this has led to the swedish danish newsletter annex b and the common nordic reference group for stan orally has announced new clinical guidelines for stan application  EOS a recently held workshop in utrecht holland will generate joint european guideline these will be sought published  EOS against this background it has been necessary to develop new guidelines for the complement of scalp ph in the stan arm of this project annex a common to the above studies is that there is consistently applied scalp ph before stan monitoring begins  EOS it is therefore important to elucidate whether through the use of stan monitoring is needed more than fbs and if so to what extent fbs is required  EOS stan method currently winning widespread in denmark and internationally fda has just approved notwithstanding that it is not scientifically proven that fetal monitoring with stan is better than the current monitoring method with scalp ph measurement  EOS it is therefore important to get this resolved in a randomized study in the relative expensive stan apparatus introduced in several places in denmark  EOS this study will provide an opportunity to highlight these issues and can prepare on our way to use stan to prevent or significantly reduce these risks and thus justify continued stan use or the continued spread of stan should not by advised  EOS if stan by our method proves to be comparable with clean scalps ph measurement as an adjunct to ctg it will be a significant advance in fetal monitoring technology taking thus will have a primarily non invasive safe and continuous method cause less inconvenience to both mother and child  EOS the study was approved by the ethical nominee directors  EOS the study will include all women years in labour with a fetus in the cephalic presentation with a gestational age of more than weeks where there is the monitoring with ctg  EOS women who develop ctg changes that are interpreted as abnormal according to stan figo guidelines and the scalp ph is normal could be included in the study  EOS women will be randomised by telephone electronic to surveillance with eighter stan monitoring or with ctg and scalp ph  EOS in the latter group stan results will be blinded hidden for later analysis  EOS there are estimated to be women in the study and the study is expected to run for years preceded by a pilotproject  EOS during the pilot project we will follow the department s usual procedures for monitoring but to ctg using the stan device with blinded concealed st analysis  EOS there is expected to be patients in the pilotproject  EOS the aim is to investigate whether the calculations in the survey stick and simultaneously train staff at the maternity ward in stan equipment and procedures and make them familiar with the work  EOS the advantage in conducting the study at the maternity ward at hvidovre hospital is that it is the largest birthplace in denmark with nearly births annually with perhaps the highest use of scalp ph measurements during labor  EOS in addition nearly births annually at roskilde county hospital a total of births  EOS in addition department and project managers areexperienced in scientific studies on fetal monitoring  EOS project participants have on their own initiative initiated this project and has no financial interest in the instrument companies that produce the used equipment appliances monitors  EOS the project has been allocated  EOS million dkr in funding for the project from elsass foundation a private foundation with no financial interest in the project equipment appliances monitors  EOS	hypothesis stan monitoring will reduce the number of

EOS number of neonates admitted to the neonatal department because of suspected asphyxia in the two groups the aim of fetal surveillance is to identify those fetuses at risk for developing damage in newborn to term or long term damage caused by lack of oxygen during birth process  EOS approximately of all cases of paralysis due to brain damage cerebral palsy is believed to be caused by lack of oxygen during birth  EOS these can be avoided if the investigators intervene actively in the birth before damage occurs  EOS cardiotocography ctg detection of fetal heart rate pattern and maternal uterine contractions via electrodes on the maternal abdomen and fetal scalp is a widely used method of fetal surveillance  EOS however it can be difficult to interpret a ctg and uncertainty in ctg interpretation may therefore lead to increase in the number of deliveries with vacuum suction and caesarean section  EOS interpretation of ctg can be improved by analyzing the acidity of a blood sample taken from the skin of the fetal scalp  EOS such a scalp ph analysis shows indirectly the fetus gets enough oxygen  EOS scalp ph measurement requires expertise and requires repeated measurements if the abnormal heart rate pattern persists  EOS this method is the normal routine at the maternity ward at hvidovre hospital roskilde county hospital  EOS the problem seems to be partially alleviated by using a newly developed method for fetal surveillance called stan st analysis  EOS by stan continuously recorded both ctg and fetal ecg electrocardiography recording of the electrical heart activity  EOS simultaneously analyzes a portion of the fetal ecg namely st part because hypoxia leads to changes in it  EOS the technique is easy to use since it only requires one

breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies among women and its mortality is related to the capacity of tumor cells to invade and produce metastases  EOS it is postulated that tumor manipulation during surgery results in the release of tumor cells into circulation or the lymphatic system and that these released cells survive due to aggregation among them or with platelets through the formation of a fibrin layer on the embolus  EOS tumor cells surviving transportation through circulation will join blood vessels and invade vascular walls forming metastases  EOS the interruption of this process might reduce survival of tumor cells and thus the formation of metastases from breast cancer cells in the lungs or other tissues  EOS	the propose for this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of desmopressin when administered perioperatively to patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery as first treatment and select the optimum dose for the clinical development of the product  EOS
traditionally mobilisation of the right hemiliver followed by right hepatic vein control before parenchymal transection has been considered the standard approach to a major right hepatectomy  EOS however this approach is often difficult and hazardous when performing liver resection for large hepatocellular carcinoma hcc or for tumors with extrahepatic organ invasion in the right retrohepatic region  EOSin setting of right hepatectomy by an anterior approach liver mobilisation is performed only at the end of parenchymal transection when all vascular connections have already been interrupted  EOSthe anterior approach was found to be associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss less blood transfusions and a lower hospital mortality rate  EOShowever excessive bleeding can occur at the deeper plane of parenchymal transection from the right hepatic vein or middle hepatic vein  EOS bleeding from the hepatic veins is closely related to the cvp  EOSour previous retrospective analysisfound that the infrahepatic inferior vena cava ivc clamping is efficacious in reducing cvp without the need of systemic fluid restriction and is associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss during complex hepatectomy  EOS the aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if the application of the anterior approach combined with infrahepatic ivc clamping during right hepatectomy for large hcc reduces intraoperative blood loss  EOS	anterior approach results in better operative and survival outcomes compared with the conventional approach in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma hcc but anterior approach has the problem of bleeding from the hepatic vein  EOS our previous study showed that infrahepatic inferior vena cava ivc clamping can reduce blood loss during conventional hepatic resection  EOS the investigators guess infrahepatic ivc clamping may also reduce blood loss in anterior approach right hepatic resection  EOS so the investigators conduct this prospective randomized controlled trial to compare anterior approach combined with infrahepatic ivc clamping and anterior approach in major right hepatectomy for large hcc  EOS

intubation using indirect videolaryngoscopy has many advantages over classic direct laryngoscopy using the macintosh laryngoscope  EOS there are many different videolaryngoscopes available and the blade differs largely between videolaryngoscopes  EOS different size and angles of blades may have an impact on the space available for insertion of the endotracheal tube  EOS the space between the blade and the palatopharyngeal wall may be reduced significantly so that there is less room in the mouth to insert an endotracheal tube  EOS positioning and manoeuvring of the endotracheal tube may consequently be more difficult and may traumatize the pharynx as was described in a few case reports especially when an endotracheal tube with a rigid stylet inserted was used  EOS	in this randomised crossover trial we measure the space between the right side of the laryngoscope blade and the right palatopharyngeal wall in a cohort of asa i iii patients with a normal mouth opening  EOS we compare the remaining spaces for seven different videolaryngoscopes and compare these to a classic macintosh laryngoscope  EOS

there has been a major improvement in the survival of hiv infected individuals with the role out highly active anti retroviral therapy haart in the public health sector by the south african government in  EOS despite the unparalleled benefits of haart there is an increasing recognition that adverse events remain an important source of morbidity and even mortality  EOS knowledge of the adverse effects of different therapeutic regimes and understanding genetic factors that modulate the risk of toxicity are important in the management of hiv aids patients  EOS there are two regimens offered in the public sector these contain a triple drug course with either a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nrti a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti or a protease inhibitor pi  EOS with adherence to treatment it is possible to convert hiv from a fatal infection to a chronic and manageable illness  EOS but unfortunately these therapeutic regimens are associated with the development of metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia insulin resistance  EOS occasionally frank diabetes and altered fat distribution such as peripheral lipoatrophy and centripetal fat accumulation  EOS there is a growing concern that these complications may lead to an increase in the long term risk of cardiovascular disease in these individuals  EOS the first regime which contains stavudine which is a nrti  EOS it is cheap and easy to administer in the short term but however is associated with more side effects with relatively higher rates of long term risks of lipoatrophy and peripheral neuropathy  EOS it is also associated with an asymptomatic or a sometimes fatal lactic acidosis it is also associated with complications such as myopathies and pancreatitis  EOS however some studies have suggested that reducing the d t dose improves the toxicity profile while maintaining efficacy  EOS tenofovir on the other hand is a nucleotide analogue it was approved in in the united states and it use has grown since its approval  EOS it is commonly used in initial therapy  EOS it has shown to have a favourable lipid and mt dna profile when compared to stavudine but however it had no difference in virological response  EOS clinical practice is moving increasingly towards the use of regimes that combine high levels of tolerability and efficacy  EOS hiv infected individuals develop a pattern similar to that of the metabolic syndrome once they initiate treatment ultimately putting them at a risk for impending cardiovascular disease in the next decades  EOS most studies have been done in the west but there is no data on patients from third world countries including south africa  EOS this purpose of this study is to prospectively identify differences between the two different nrtis stavudine a nucleoside analogue in different doses and tenofovir a nucleotide analogue to assess their virological response molecular biochemical and clinical pictures

initiate treatment which may also ultimately put them at a risk for impending heart disease in the next decades  EOS the main mechanism through which the main hiv drugs are thought to cause these metabolic changes and organ toxicities is mitochondrial toxicity  EOS most of studies that have been done have taken place in the west but few if any have been done in south africa  EOS the purpose of

introduction pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by remodeling of small pulmonary arteries leading to a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance resulting to right heart failure and ultimately death  EOS the disease is diagnosed when symptomatic demonstrating the existence of an already advanced form of the disease  EOS indeed there is no simple tool allowing an early diagnosis of pah and the disease is usually diagnosed in advanced stages  EOS diagnostic confirmation of pah is based on the elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressures measured during right heart catheterization  EOS despite the development of specific treatment in recent years pah remains a disease with poor prognosis for which no cure is possible apart from lung transplantation in selected cases  EOS however recent studies have shown that specific drug therapy in early disease stages could improve the prognosis of this life threatening disease  EOS this is why it seems important to

randomized prospective trial of minimally invasive surgery versus standard surgery for correction of hallux valgus  EOS introduction it is estimated that more than hallux valgus surgeries are performed each year in the united states  EOS more than procedures have been described for correction of hallux valgus  EOS considerable controversy remains over the best technique  EOS recently a number of minimally invasive techniques for correction of hallux valgus have been described  EOS  EOS these minimally invasive techniques emphasize less traumatic surgical exposure and more limited dissection of the soft tissues  EOS it has been proposed that minimally invasive procedures lead to less pain decreased swelling shorter recovery times and more rapid return to full weightbearing activities  EOS not all reports have been positive and some authors report an increased number of complications including loss of correction and malposition of the bones  EOS minimally invasive treatment of hallux valgus is becoming increasingly common in podiatric and orthopedic clinical practice due to the theoretical advantages of more rapid recovery more rapid return to full activities and decreased pain  EOS these techniques have the potential advantage of providing better clinical outcomes and having lower cost  EOS an increasing number of research publications on this topic have appeared in recent years which reflects both growing interest and development in this field amongst foot and ankle surgeons  EOS however despite the increasing interest there are no high quality studies of these procedures available  EOS in a systematic review publications describing the outcomes of minimally invasive hallux valgus surgery were identified and analyzed  EOS all the studies were level iv quality case series with the exception of two that were level iii a retrospective comparative studies  EOS no randomized prospective controlled studies have been published and validated disease specific outcomes measures are seldom used  EOS no high quality trials of any minimally invasive techniques have been published and as a result basic questions still remain unanswered do minimally invasive procedures have fewer complications than standard procedures ? are minimally invasive procedures associated with superior patient based outcomes ? are the radiographic outcomes of minimally invasive techniques equivalent ? randomized prospective clinical trials are required utilizing validated outcomes measures  EOS study objectives to compare the patient based outcomes and radiographic outcomes of minimally invasive surgery versus standard surgery for correction of hallux valgus  EOS primary outcomes measure the primary outcomes measure is the manchester oxford foot

though patients with frequent hospital admissions comprise a small percentage of all patients they account for a disproportionate share of visits and costs  EOS their substantial use of health care resources is often a result of the simultaneous presence of severe medical and social co morbidities  EOS these high cost cases have caught the attention of policy makers and have created a movement by states to shift medicaid patients from fee for service into managed care models or high risk case management programs  EOS such state initiatives create an impetus for hospitals and health care providers to better understand and control expenditures for the highest users of health services  EOS the work proposed for this application will address this gap in the literature through the use of a group randomized trial design using quantitative to evaluate outcomes  EOS this proposal is a logical extension of our previous work for the past three years we have been conducting research on improving care coordination for this patient population via in depth needs assessment model program development and implementation of a pilot initiative at a safety net hospital for a limited number

impact of the cidp initiative the intervention is currently designed as a group randomized trial that will track and compare the health care utilization and costs in intervention and control groups

ability of the evaluation to analyze the effect of important factors we anticipate will be improved by this innovative care redesign initiative e  EOSg  EOS social support housing status on health services utilization is thus sharply curtailed limiting the outcomes being studied to those derivable from administrative claims data  EOS we thus propose to conduct an in depth evaluation of the hhc cidp enrollees to determine whether specific outcomes related to health functional status and quality of life resulting from a patient centered intensive care coordination and management intervention correlate with improved linkage to primary care while reducing hospitalizations and emergency department visits  EOS we will then relate these benefits to program costs using standard cost effectiveness analysis techniques  EOS our program model is innovative in its approach employing care management teams comprised of social workers community based care managers and dedicated clinicians who work to meet patients needs in both the health care setting and the community  EOS specific aim to compare changes in outcomes related to health status quality of life and care satisfaction between high risk intervention patients and controls using quantitative and qualitative methods  EOS associated hypotheses compared to baseline assessments administered at the time of enrollment  EOS intervention patients will have measurable improvements in health status as measured by the sf and the phq at month follow up  EOS enrollees will have measurable improvements in quality of life as measured by the perceived availability of support scale the chaos scale and housing status at and month follow up  EOS  EOS intervention patients will have measurable improvements in personal satisfaction with health care as measured by the psq at and month follow up  EOS specific aim to determine if improvements in linkage to primary care defined as visits to the same clinic within months and reduced use of acute care services emergency department visits and hospital admissions are associated with improved health status quality of life and personal satisfaction with health care  EOS associated hypotheses  EOS improvements in measures of health status are associated with improved linkage to primary care and reductions in use of acute care services  EOS  EOS improvements in measures of quality of life are associated with improved linkage to primary care and reductions in use of acute care services  EOS  EOS improvements in measures of personal satisfaction are associated with improved linkage to primary care and reductions in use of acute care services  EOS specific aim to understand the economic impact of the intervention by measuring its component financial and societal costs and to perform a cost effectiveness analysis for primary and secondary outcomes  EOS associated hypotheses  EOS the overall reduction in health care costs will meet or exceed the cost of the intervention accounting for all intervention related costs  EOS  EOS the intervention will have favorable value compared to alternative uses of healthcare resources for this priority population  EOS  EOS  EOSa  EOS the cost of the intervention per hospitalization averted and associated mortality will be favorable  EOS  EOS  EOSb the cost of the intervention per improvement in qaly will be favorable	medicaid insured patients with frequent hospitalizations account for a disproportionate share of visits and costs and have caught the attention of policy makers creating an impetus for hospitals and health care providers to better understand and control associated expenditures  EOS many such patients have specific unmet health and social needs  EOS based on our extensive pilot work with this population the new york state department of health recently awarded the new york city health and hospitals corporation one of seven statewide contracts to implement a chronic illness demonstration project aimed at improving care and reducing healthcare expenditures for high cost medicaid patients  EOS within this framework the investigators propose a group randomized trial design to test whether specific outcomes related to health functional status and quality of life resulting from a patient centered intensive care coordination and management intervention correlate with improved linkage to primary care while reducing hospitalizations and emergency department visits  EOS the investigators will then relate these benefits to program costs using standard cost effectiveness analysis techniques  EOS given that there are few examples of successful interventions for this population and currently unparalleled medicaid spending there is an urgent need to demonstrate that interventions to improve care coordination and optimize patients use of the health and social care system result in more efficient and less costly care  EOS
there will be a single study visit  EOS in a quiet examination room the patient alert tones will be demonstrated to the subjects  EOS subsequently this will be repeated with a wall air conditioner turned on  EOS the subjects will then be asked to complete a three part questionnaire regarding their perceptions of the patient alert tones  EOS data analysis will include overall ability to hear tones as well as subgroup analysis according to gender age and bmi  EOS simultaneously in order to calculate the loudness of the alert tones digital recordings will be obtained using two microphones located near the subject  EOS these digital recordings will be analyzed and a loudness value will be calculated  EOS the loudness value is a calculated index devised by medtronic which incorporates frequency and intensity  EOS data analysis will include a correlation between loudness value and patient characteristics and between loudness value and ability of subjects to perceive the tones  EOS	the purpose of this study is to determine whether the alert tones emitted by the latest generation of medtronic implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds are audible to patients  EOS icd patients can have difficulties hearing the beeps which are designed to notify patients of possible lead or generator malfunction  EOS in fact the only published study of this issue conducted at englewood hospital and medical center revealed that only of patients with older medtronic devices were able to hear alerts  EOS since then modifications to the alert have been made by medtronic  EOS this study will establish the real world value of these changes and also provide useful in vivo information regarding the validity of the in vitro techniques which have been used thus far to design the patient alert feature  EOS
in this study we propose to evaluate the utility of radial strain imaging using speckle tracking to predict the response to crt in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy icmp with nyha functional class heart failure and a standard guideline based crt indication and to determine the value of lead localization determined by radial strain imaging in a prospective randomized manner  EOS we will compare two randomized groups of crt recipients implanted with crt d systems  EOS in the control group implantation will be performed in the usual manner and the lead will be placed at the discretion of the implanting physician preferably at posterolateral lv sites  EOS in the study group leads will be placed in areas of latest contraction that lack significant scar as determined by speckle tracking imaging  EOS the primary outcome measure for comparison between the groups will be echocardiographic response as assessed by percent reduction in left ventricular end systolic volumes at months post implantation  EOS in addition clinical response parameters will also be measured as secondary end points  EOS we hypothesize that patients showing greater dyssynchrony and or discoordination index with speckle tracking will derive a significantly greater response to cardiac resynchronization therapy and patients allocated to the image guided lv lead placement group will derive a significantly greater response to crt than patients in the non guided implantation control group  EOS if radial strain imaging proves useful for improving the crt response rate and identification of patients likely to respond it will have important clinical and economic implications by improving individual outcomes and more effective utilization of constrained health care resources  EOS furthermore if echo guided lead implantation proves to be effective in reducing the relatively large non response rate to cardiac resynchronization therapy it will likely result in increased device utilization among eligible heart failure patients  EOS specific aims aim to show that in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy implantation of a crt lv lead guided by radial strain imaging results in a significantly greater echocardiographic and clinical response to cardiac resynchronization therapy compared with conventional implantation techniques  EOS aim to show that speckle tracking strain data can be used to identify the degree of echocardiographic response to crt using both dyssynchrony time to peak strain and discoordination indices  EOS aim the paieon substudy will comprise patients enrolled at centers for whom additional information mechanical dyssynchrony using the paieon cardioguide motion map will be collected during device implantation as detailed below the primary aim of the study is to relate data of mechanical dyssynchrony obtained from angiography through the paieon cardioguide motion map to dyssynchrony data obtained from the echocardiogram  EOS the dyssynchrony data will not be available to the treating physicians and will not be used to direct the lv lead location  EOS	the purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of radial strain imaging using speckle tracking analysis to predict the response to crt in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy icmp with nyha functional class heart failure and a standard guideline based crt indication  EOS thus assessing the value of lead localization determined by radial strain imaging in a prospective randomized manner  EOS
the rationale for the study was as follows  EOS on the basis of the pre clinical studies the original target disease for yf was gastro oesophageal reflux disease gord not only because of the excellent anti secretory activity of yf but also because of its potential for increasing gastric emptying  EOS but loss of the anti secretory effect of yf in healthy subjects after repeated dosing excludes its use as an anti secretory agent in patients with gord  EOS however there is some evidence from within our repeated dose studies in healthy subjects that gastrin receptors are blocked despite loss of the anti secretory activity of yf  EOS further evidence that repeated doses of yf cause sustained blockade of gastrin receptors comes from several types of study in animals  EOS first in the week toxicology studies all dose levels of yf reduced the ecl population unlike other anti secretory agents histamine h antagonists and proton pump inhibitors which increase the ecl population  EOS second yf at doses of  EOS and  EOS mg kg subcutaneously twice daily for days in rats abolished the increase in gastric output induced by pentagastrin on days and  EOS this protocol describes a study in healthy subjects using inhibition of pentagastrin induced gastric acid output as a surrogate marker of efficacy of yf  EOS pentagastrin has been used for many years to test gastric function in healthy subjects and patients  EOS intravenous infusion of  EOS micrograms kg hour is a submaximal and well tolerated dose  EOS	the objective of the study was to assess the effect of a range of single oral doses of yf on pentagastrin induced gastric acid output in healthy volunteers

background fructose has become a focus of intense concern regarding its links to the obesity epidemic  EOS there have been dozens of editorials commentaries and letters in the scientific literature and numerous pieces in the lay and social media calling for efforts to restrict its intake and even regulate it like tobacco or alcohol  EOS uncontrolled observational studies which have linked increasing fructose intake with increasing obesity rates since the s and animal models of fructose overfeeding at levels of exposure far beyond actual population levels of intake have been used to underpin this debate  EOS evidence from observational studies and controlled feeding trials also suggest a positive association between the consumption of fructose containing sugar sweetened beverages in which high fructose corn syrup hfcs is the main sweetener and increased energy consumption and weight gain but not all meta analyses have supported this conclusion  EOS despite the limitations in extrapolating from these data and their inconsistency with data from controlled trials in humans the highest level of evidence used in evidence based medicine the american heart association aha have taken a risk reduction approach to added fructose containing sugars especially those from sugar sweetened beverages ssbs setting highly restrictive upper thresholds for their intake to achieve and maintain healthy body weights  EOS objective to improve the evidence on which recommendations and public health policy are based we propose to conduct a systematic review and meta analysis of the effect of fructose containing ssbs on body weight in controlled feeding trials  EOS design the planning and conduct of the proposed meta analyses will follow the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions  EOS the reporting will follow the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guidelines  EOS data sources  EOS medline embase cinahl and the

decision makers will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future guidelines  EOS preliminary findings we conducted a systematic review and meta analysis to investigate the effect of dietary fructose on body weight in controlled feeding trials sievenpiper et al  EOS ann intern med  EOS  EOS we identified isocaloric trials n in which fructose was exchanged for the same amount of carbohydrate in the diet and hypercaloric trials n in which the diet was supplemented with excess energy from high dose fructose  EOS whereas there was no effect of fructose under isocaloric trial conditions fructose under hypercaloric trial conditions g day energy significantly and consistently increased weight md  EOS kg or  EOS lb ci  EOS to  EOS kg or  EOS to  EOS lb  EOS in both analyses fructose behaved no differently than sucrose or hfcs where these sugars were the comparators and fructose in fluid beverage form did not increase body weight in the isocaloric trials  EOS we concluded that the available trials did not support a body weight raising effect of fructose in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrate  EOS there was however consistent evidence for a modest body weight raising effect of fructose at extreme doses providing excess energy where the effect of energy appeared to be dominant  EOS the implications of our findings for real world dietary advice was complicated by the fact that sucrose and hfcs are the primary fructose containing sweeteners in the us diet  EOS the proposed systematic review and meta analysis will address this limitation directly by investigating the effect of all fructose containing fructose sucrose and hfcs ssbs  EOS significance the proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of dietary fructose on overweight and obesity strengthening the evidence base for recommendations and improving health outcomes through informing consumers and guiding future research  EOS	since uncontrolled observational studies first linked fructose to the epidemic of obesity almost a decade ago it has become a focus of intense concern regarding its role in the obesity epidemic  EOS despite the uncertainties in the evidence the recommendations of international health organizations have cautioned against moderate to high intakes fructose containing sugars especially those from sugar sweetened beverages ssbs  EOS to improve the evidence on which nutrition recommendations are based the investigators propose to study of the effect of fructose containing sugar sweetened beverages ssbs on body weight by undertaking a systematic synthesis of the data taken from all available clinical studies in humans  EOS this technique has the strength of allowing all of the available data to be pooled together and differences to be explored in groups of different study participants healthy humans of different sex weight and age and in those with diseases which predispose to disturbances in metabolism such as diabetes with dietary fructose in different forms doses and with differing durations of exposure  EOS the findings generated by this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing recommendations for the general public as well as those at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease

crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis uc are both chronic idiopathic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that result in a considerably decreased quality of life  EOS long term experience with standard therapies for inflammatory bowel disease patients up to the late s demonstrated diverse limitations  EOS corticosteroids have good short term efficacy but are not suitable for maintaining remission while treatment with immunomodulators are associated with an important risk of side effects  EOS the introduction of monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor a tnfa therapy has offered new treatment options originally in patients with crohn s disease and more recently in those with ulcerative colitis as well  EOS several clinicians based on the results of clinical trials now advocate the early use of intensive therapy immunosuppressants and or biologics to maintain a good quality of life from the first flare up and prevent any irreversible consequence of the disease  EOS meanwhile the assessment of tissue healing has become of paramount importance in patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease  EOS simple clinical assessment does not reflect real activity and inflammation at the tissue level  EOS moreover cumulative tissue damage generated by the persisting tissue inflammation leads to non reversible anatomic and functional consequences  EOS therefore in order to evaluate both the natural history and impact of treatment in inflammatory bowel disease standardized assessment of tissue healing must be available  EOS endoscopic and histological healing has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of recurrence of the disease in addition to reduced hospitalization and surgery  EOS furthermore in patients treated with costly and highly immunosuppressive tnf a antagonists achievement of an objective treatment response is essential  EOS consequently endoscopic healing should be regarded as the primary approach in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease  EOS although several clinical trials have identified at diagnosis factors predictive of a subsequent disabling course of the disease therefore identifying patients that

scheduled to attend a baseline evaluation at the pelvic floor laboratory at queen s university or at the dr  EOS linda mclean s pelvic floor laboratory at the university of ottawa  EOS at this first visit eligibility of the participant will be confirmed based on the bladder diary results they must have experienced at least one episode of urine leakage over the three day diary a pad test and the absence of evidence of any neurological cause of pelvic floor muscle dysfunction  EOS those who are still eligible will have their height and weight recorded and bladder volume will be measured using trans abdominal ultrasound us imaging  EOS if the bladder volume is at least ml then the participant will begin a standardized pad test i  EOSe  EOS a circuit of walking and stair climbing for minutes

controlled feeding trials  EOS we found that pulses alone or in low glycemic index or high fibre diets improved markers of glycemic control  EOS although the improvement was clinically significant it came at the expense of substantial inter study heterogeneity  EOS knowledge translation from this preliminary project has already begun  EOS it has provided a rationale for a large trial of the effect of pulses in type diabetes to address some of the identified sources of heterogeneity and is being used in the development of the cda clinical practice guidelines cpg for nutrition therapy  EOS significance the proposed project will demonstrate that the improvement in longterm glycemic control seen in our previous systematic review and meta analysis of longterm randomized controlled feeding trials of pulses can be attributed to acute reductions in postprandial glycemia reductions in appetite and decreased intake at subsequent meals  EOS this demonstration will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of dietary pulses on cardiometabolic risk strengthening the evidence base for dietary recommendations and health claims and improving health outcomes through informing healthcare providers and patients stimulating industry innovation and guiding future research  EOS	dietary pulses beans peas chickpeas and lentils more commonly known as legumes are generally recognized as healthy components of the diet  EOS canada s food guide encourages consumptions of meat alternatives such as beans more often and the dietary guidelines for americans both recommend consumption of cups of legumes per week  EOS however there remains insufficient information on the usefulness of these foods in protecting heart health  EOS to improve evidence based guidance for dietary pulse recommendations the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review of the effect of dietary pulse consumption on after meal blood sugar levels appetite and food intake regulation to help explain their mechanism for improving longterm blood sugar and body weight control  EOS the systematic review process allows the combining of the results from many small studies in order to arrive at a pooled estimate similar to a weighted average of the true effect  EOS the investigators will be able to explore whether eating pulses has different effects between men and women in different age groups and background disease states and whether or not the effect of pulses depends on the dose and background diet  EOS the findings of this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of canadians through informing recommendations for the general public as well as those at risk of heart disease and diabetes  EOS

background fructose has become a focus of intense concern regarding its links to the obesity epidemic and increasing burden of cardiometabolic disease  EOS there have been dozens of editorials commentaries and letters in the scientific literature and numerous pieces in the lay and social media calling for efforts to restrict its intake and even regulate it like tobacco or alcohol  EOS uncontrolled ecological analyses which have linked increasing fructose intake with increasing obesity diabetes and hypertension rates and animal models of fructose induced metabolic syndrome and hypertension which overfeed fructose at levels of exposure far beyond actual population levels of intake have been used to underpin this debate  EOS evidence from well adjusted prospective cohort studies also suggest a positive association between the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and increased energy consumption and weight gain  EOS but not all meta analyses of the available

nerve blocks are used by anesthesiologists as methods of pain control or to allow for painless surgery on a limb rendering a general anesthetic for surgery unnecessary  EOS local anesthetic medication is injected through a needle next to a nerve often using an ultrasound machine to visualize both the needle and nerve simultaneously  EOS a catheter a small plastic tube can be inserted next to the nerve in order to provide pain relief for hours or days after surgery  EOS the nerves that provide sensation to the forearm wrist and hand are the radial median ulnar musculocutaneous and medial nerve of the forearm  EOS these nerves originate from a network of nerve fibers that exit the spinal cord at the level of the neck  EOS they are tightly bundled together forming the brachial plexus from the neck to just above the axilla providing the anesthesiologist with many locations to perform a nerve block  EOS one such block known as the infraclavicular block approaches the nerves just beneath the clavicle and has been performed for decades  EOS this study aims to examine a new technique to block the brachial plexus performed at a similar level as the infraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block  EOS the ultrasound guided retroclavicular brachial plexus block has the potential advantages of being easier to perform more successful less painful for the patient and a better pathway for catheter placement  EOS it differs from the infraclavicular nerve block in that the needle is inserted above the clavicle rather than below it  EOS in addition it will allow the anesthesiologist to have another approach to the brachial plexus which can be utilized if patients cannot have an infraclavicular block or any other brachial plexus block due to anatomical changes or infection at the sight  EOS the retroclavicular brachial plexus block was first used in two patients at brigham and women s hospital in whom the infraclavicular approach was contraindicated due to anatomical changes after surgery or trauma  EOS this procedure has been found to be a reliable way to perform a brachial plexus nerve block and has become a routine procedure at brigham and women s hospital for hand or forearm surgery over the past three years  EOS in reviewing the literature a similar procedure was introduced by hebbard and royse in but no patient data was reported  EOS by assessing the procedure in a prospective study the investigators will be able to describe the technique the success rate and any complications in the literature to allow other anesthesiologists to potentially incorporate this block into their repertoire  EOS	the primary objective of this prospective descriptive study is to evaluate the success rate of the retroclavicular brachial plexus block and catheter placement in adult patients undergoing hand wrist or forearm surgery  EOS the investigators will also evaluate any difficulties performing the procedure the onset time and distribution of the block incidence of adverse events and patient s acceptance of the block  EOS
we reviewed the charts of patients who underwent primary surgery for type ii iv hiatal hernia during the period from january december  EOS pre operatively the patients routinely underwent symptom assessment a barium swallow upper gi endoscopy and esophageal manometry  EOS the principles of surgery for gerd and hiatal hernias involve full isolation of the diaphragmatic pillars and e g junction full isolation and resection of the sac and fat pad into the mediastinum except for the fat close to the lesser curvature to preserve the integrity of the vagus nerves evaluation of the degree of esophageal shortening and a collis gastroplasty in cases of short esophagi  EOS post operatively the patients participated in a free of charge outpatient follow up program at months months and every year for years  EOS the length of the follow up was calculated from the day of the surgery to the day that the patient underwent the last complete follow up  EOS the type and severity of symptoms and the grade of reflux esophagitis were scored using a questionnaire with semi quantitative scales from absence of symptoms and esophagitis to severe symptoms and esophagitis  EOS an evaluation scale for the surgical results with scores ranging from excellent to poor was also used  EOS	surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd and hiatal hernia hh can achieve outcomes that afford the patient lifelong satisfaction  EOS the published results obtained with this surgery may not be considered to be definitive in relation to the length of follow up or patients life expectancy  EOS the real recurrence rates and the results of surgery for gerd are difficult to assess due to the lack of serial time points during the follow up  EOS further bias may have been introduced into the analysis by a lack of appropriate controls  EOS the results of surgical therapy for type ii iv hh are even more controversial because of the high rate of anatomical relapse and the different methods of follow up adopted in reported case series  EOS aim of this study is to clarify the value of surgical therapy for type ii iv hh  EOS the investigators report on patients who were followed up after surgery at various time points over the course of years  EOS

methamphetamine meth is a highly addictive stimulant and acute exposure causes dopamine da release and stimulates midbrain reward centers  EOS the proposed work represents an important research effort with considerable public health significance in that it will evaluate a compound targeted specifically at da transporter dat inhibition for the treatment of meth dependence  EOS the knowledge gained may ultimately support development and implementation of evidence based treatments for meth dependence a drug abuse problem with tremendous public health impact  EOS one therapeutic strategy is to develop and test compounds that normalize increase da to determine if treatment with these drugs reduces meth use  EOS a similar approach has been proposed as a treatment for cocaine dependence howell and wilcox mello and negus another disorder associated with abnormally low da activity martinez et al  EOS  EOS in an effort to identify a dat selective inhibitor a number of phenyltropane analogs were synthesized by rti international  EOS among these preclinical studies have shown that rti produced cocaine like discriminative stimulus effects and reduced cocaine self administration in rats and produced dose dependent suppression of cocaine self administration in rhesus monkeys  EOS rti recently received ind approval for preliminary safety testing in healthy male volunteers and is scheduled to be completed by february  EOS subsequent to this effort rti will be evaluated in a phase i trial involving cocaine dependent volunteers  EOS the current application puts forth for the first time a proposal to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of this very promising candidate medication in non treatment seeking meth dependent volunteers  EOS	the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rti as a treatment for methamphetamine meth dependence in non treatment seeking meth dependent volunteers  EOS
evidence based interventions for autism spectrum disorders asd are limited  EOS currently there is no fda approved medical therapy that addresses either core asd symptoms or pathophysiological processes associated with asd  EOS for example the two fda approved antipsychotic medications for treating asd are indicated for symptoms associated with asd not core asd symptoms  EOS based on strong preliminary evidence this study aims to improve core asd symptoms with folinic acid  EOS two biological mechanisms for response to the intervention are proposed and investigated in this study  EOS folate is an essential b vitamin required for normal neurodevelopment  EOS folinic acid is a reduced form of folate that has been shown to improve both the metabolic and core symptoms associated with asd in an open label study and large case series  EOS this study will extend this preliminary evidence to demonstrate clinical efficacy of folinic acid in a double blind placebo controlled manner while also evaluating the biological mechanisms associated with the clinical response  EOS preliminary evidence for the efficacy of folinic acid is two fold first several independent studies have demonstrated that a folinic acid intervention improves asd core symptoms in asd patients diagnosed with cerebral folate deficiency a metabolic disorder in which the primary pathway for the transport of folate across the blood brain barrier is dysfunctional  EOS the primary transport pathway for folate across the blood brain barrier uses the folate receptor fr and energy dependent endocytosis  EOS a secondary pathway the reduced folate carrier rfc can transport reduced forms of folate such as folinic acid across the blood brain barrier  EOS in case series of children with asd and cerebral folate deficiency folinic acid  EOS to mg kg day improved communication social interaction attention and stereotypical behavior in some and completely ameliorated asd symptoms in others  EOS the major cause of cerebral folate deficiency is an autoantibody that binds to the fr and interferes with its ability to bind and transport folate  EOS recently frye et al  EOS found that a autoantibodies to the fr were present in approximately of children with asd and b an intervention with folinic acid mg kg day max mg in children with asd and fr autoantibodies resulted in significant improvements in parental ratings of receptive and expressive language verbal communication stereotypic behavior and attention as compared to parental rating for children that did not undergo any intervention wait group over a similar time period  EOS this proposal will extend these preliminary findings by documenting response to a folinic acid intervention in a double blind placebo controlled manner and test whether fr autoantibody titers predict response to a folinic acid intervention  EOS if fr autoantibody titers are found to predict response to the intervention such titers could provide a biomarker to identify a subset of children with asd that may benefit from a folinic acid intervention and may even predict the development of asd symptoms in high risk siblings during the presymptomatic period  EOS second the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione gsh gssg is an established measure of systemic redox status and oxidative stress that has been shown in three independent case control studies to be significantly decreased in many asd children  EOS james et al  EOS have shown in a month open label clinical trial that an intervention of folinic acid and methyl b significantly improved gsh gssg and vineland scores for expressive language receptive language and socialization in asd children  EOS important unanswered questions are a whether this preliminary data can be confirmed in a larger double blind placebo controlled study b whether redox status before the folinic acid intervention can predict response to intervention and c whether improved systemic redox status is associated with improvement in core asd symptoms  EOS this study will assess whether a folinic acid intervention can improve both core symptoms of asd i  EOSe  EOS communication socialization stereotyped movements and associated comorbid symptoms i  EOSe  EOS attention in a double blind placebo controlled clinical trial  EOS this study will address whether improvements in core asd symptoms associated with the intervention are related to biomarkers of either or both biological mechanisms proposed to be influenced by the intervention i  EOSe  EOS gsh gssg fr autoantibody titer  EOS thus using these biomarkers it may be possible that children with asd who optimally respond to the folinic acid intervention can be readily identified early after diagnosis or even during the pre symptomatic period  EOS this double blind placebo controlled dbpc study will evaluate the efficacy of folinic acid for the treatment of language impaired autism spectrum disorder patients aged years  EOS the study will consist of a single site trial with approximatley entering the dbpc phase  EOS subjects will be male or female with current or prospective diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd  EOS language impairments will be defined by the celf or pls when warranted  EOS phase will consist of approximately children aged with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder as defined by the autism diagnostic observation schedule or the autism diagnostic interview revised until approximately children with confirmed asd are enrolled into a randomized control trial rct phase  EOS enrollment will continue as needed until approximately complete phase  EOS approximately will enroll into phase  EOS initial analyses will be undertaken to inspect data for errors inconsistencies and incomplete information  EOS this will include examining the data with simple frequency tables and dot plots for univariate data and scatter plots and multi way dot plots with bivariate and multivariate data  EOS to summarize bivariate relationships among predictors and between predictors and outcomes spearman s rank correlation coefficient will be used  EOS for reporting inferential statistics regression coefficients along with the percent confidence intervals will be used extensively to quantify degree of clinical importance  EOS the primary population will be the intent to treat itt population and is defined as all subjects who have completed at least one post treatment primary outcome measure  EOS a secondary analysis will be performed on the as treated population defined as those subjects who had at least compliance of prescribed medications and have not significantly deviated from the protocol  EOS to determine whether the folinic acid intervention over a week period improves core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in phase the procedure proc mixed in sas will be used to fit a mixed model analysis of covariance  EOS for the multisite study the full model with the response variable language assessment will include predictors such as intervention time autoantibody intervention by time interaction autoantibody by intervention interaction redox status redox status by time interaction and baseline covariates  EOS however for the single site study the number of variables in the model will be limited due to the smaller sample size and separate models will be performed on subgroups to compare the effects of the treatment in various subgroups  EOS the results from the mixed model will determine if the biomarkers of physiological abnormalities both autoantibodies and redox status predict intervention response  EOS similar analysis will be performed for the secondary outcomes  EOS	researchers at arkansas children s hospital research institute are conducting a study looking at the effects of folinic acid on language in autism spectrum disorder and language impairment  EOS the study has phases  EOS phase confirms that your child has language impairment there is no compensation for this visit  EOS if language impairment is verified in the phase screening then your child will be eligible for phase  EOS phase consists of receiving weeks of folinic acid or an inactive placebo in addition to several evaluations of your child s abilities and a single blood test  EOS children that complete phase will be eligible for a week open label trial of folinic acid
